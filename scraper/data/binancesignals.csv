and welcome to the most unique Crypto Day Trading, and Swing trading channel. We will keep you updated about the market's mouvement on a daily basis in a special way, my trading skills are a bit advanced than the other Telegram channels, so I would like to explain to you a little bit about my daily setup.
**Day Trade:** So, I mostly focus on day trading, in this channel you will be finding daily updates about the information that Bitcoin, is generating. Starting off by our FIRST point of vision which is going to be about
1. **Bitcoin Big Picture ** (Timeframe 1D & 4HR): On every Sunday I will be making a chart based on the big timeframe (4HR/1D), and I will be showing you what is most likely going to happen, and what are the possible scenarios. After that we will be moving to the smaller picture
2. **Bitcoin Smaller Picture** (Timeframes 2HR & 1HR & 30 Minutes): Now this comes when the US Session starts, I will be sharing with you the important levels that we will be forming for the day BASED ON:
-Daily Value
-Daily Initial Balance
-Last 3 days balance (Inorder to see if we are on a trend, or we are going sideways.
-Previous US Session High
-Previous US Session Low
-Gap
-Yesterday Session CC Level (0.618 Fib)
-Orderblocks",2022-12-08 09:05:05+00:00,7,1673124233

This one will be based on a lot of strategies, it depends on the coin that I will be trading, if it's an altcoin / classical coin. Just like on day trading, whenever I provide a Swing Trade I will try my best to explain my point of vision to you.
Here you won't only be updated about the market only, but you will also learn with us. We will try our best to provide you useful knowledge. Be active, supportive, and stay loyal to our community. AND LETS MOON! üåîüöÄ",2022-12-08 09:08:22+00:00,8,1673124233

Timeframe: 1D
Observation: We are currently seeing a rejection from this liquidity zone, we have failed to break above it so we should see a rejection to the downside.

Observation: Right now bitcoin is forming a parallel channel to the upside, it has followed a prediction that I have made, as you can see it has formed a double top and started dumping, right now we broke below the neckline, so there is a good possibility for continuing to the downside until we retest the trendline of the parallel channel, and the zone of 8 Point of Controls where I'm placing my next longs.",2022-12-08 09:19:43+00:00,10,1673124233

Timeframe: 4 Hours
Observation: We have been going sideways for 10 days, the grey rectangle is the balance of this zone of this consolidation where small traders are scalping inside of it until we have a breakout.
In my opinion, we could see a rejection from here, we move to the downside where we form triple bottom, retest the bottom of this balance, and the support of our parallel channel and then we start seeing a massive mouvement to the upside. Otherwise we will just continue pumping. üìä",2022-12-09 05:31:33+00:00,12,1673124233

Timeframe: 30 Minutes
Analysis: Basically the US Session has opened, right now the first hour has passed. We have formed our initial balance, and the market has generated some informations for us.
**Red Horizontal Line**= Daily Point of Control
**Yellow Line:**= 0.618 Fibonacci of previous session.
**(IB)**= Initial balance
**(PS)**= Previous Session
**Blue Rectangle**= Daily VALUE",2022-12-09 14:38:53+00:00,14,1673124233
9,-1001673124233,"**PREDICTION**= There are some STRONG levels of resistances on the upside
1. Previous Session high
2. Initial balance resistance
3. Resistance of Point of Control is above us
4. Resistance of the value is above us
We need to get more liquidity from the downside in-order to break upwards, for that to happen in my opinion I believe that we should retest the 0.618 Fibonacci level, OR the previous session low where we could also retest the parallel channel that you could see on the 4 Hours chart.

298,-1001673124233,"Since most of you asked about the current market situation, writing my initial thoughts here. There are currently two scenarios here: 

1- First, we should test the may low, the 28K region. This region has strong resistance and you can never expect price to go straight through this resistance level. A push to 20K might also be possible if we get a hard rejection. 

2- In the second scenario, looking at the data and liquidation heatmaps, we have cleared almost 60% liquidity sitting above 26K region, we still have some more to grab between $26.5K and $27K which can be targeted. Keeping in mind that this liquidity has been cleared and you got rejected below $25K again, ideally you should go to $19.6K once again and then depending on interest rate hike decisions etc, you may bounce or may stay flat. 

Another aspect to all of this is the interest rate hike decision in last days of March, they may pause the rate hikes or maybe 25 bps but in any case I have explained the plan long before which has been good so far. The only catch here is ""CZ"" who is yet to spend those $1B to buy $BTC, $ETH, $BNB. He is ofcourse not as stupid as you, buy high sell low, he needs to buy low, sell high and the only chance he has of buying is going in $20K, $21K region in my opinion. So, in all the different scenarios, you are looking to revisit those areas again. Hope it explain everything!",2023-03-16 08:04:16+00:00,338,1673124233

The Core PCE price index is a measure of the change in the cost of goods and services purchased by consumers, excluding food and energy. It is distinct from the Core CPI in that it only considers items that individuals buy and consume, with prices weighted according to overall spending per item. This provides valuable insights into consumer spending behavior.

The expected value for this release is 0.4%, while the previous figure was 0.6%. The Core PCE Price Index is a critical metric for the Federal Reserve to assess inflation, and they monitor it closely to inform their future monetary policy decisions.

357,-1001673124233,"The recent price rally of Bitcoin (BTC) has been attributed to various factors, including the banking crisis and the massive liquidity injection by the US Federal Reserve. These events have created a strong narrative that has influenced market sentiment. 

However, since then, the rate of liquidity injections has stalled, and if it remains stagnant, it could also dampen BTC's momentum. With BTC trading at range highs and experiencing a large liquidity grab towards the upside, it is likely that the price will range for some time. Furthermore, there are significant sellers stepping in around 28.7 every time, which could also contribute to a longer period of price range. 

Nevertheless, if the range is broken, the next potential price point could be at 32K. In general, the high timeframe of BTC is not bearish, but it is important to remain open-minded and stay informed about the factors that are moving the markets. 

In the coming weeks, the ETH Shanghai upgrade is expected to occur, which may lead to some selling pressure on the market. However, it is difficult to predict how the staking unlocks will impact the market. 

If BTC cools off a bit, the altcoins could potentially perform well. Currently, the dominance of BTC is around 48-50%, which could create good confluence for altcoin price movements. It is essential to keep an eye on the markets and remain informed about any developments that may impact price movements.",2023-03-30 14:51:00+00:00,403,1673124233

Observation: We know where could the continuation be, and where the reversal could happen, right now we have broke below a dashed trend to the upside, currently forming a downtrend, since the third rejection, we have got an horizontal level of support at the price of 29800 which I believe where we could go for long scalps, in my opinion we will keep rejecting from here, so anyway there are two scenarios to happen after that, we will either form a head and shoulders pattern and dump, or we will breakout above the downtrend and continue pumping until the price of 31800 / 32K Weekly resistances.",2023-06-26 14:50:44+00:00,673,1673124233
