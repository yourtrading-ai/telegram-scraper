- Lets anyone buy a ticket with crypto or credit card
- Send a confirmation e-mail (only when tx has been confirmed)
- Asks for metada and encrypts it
- Allows for transfer of tickets (and update of associated metadata)

And also:
- A way for us to track the tickets that have been sold
- The possibility of creating different ticket categories
- Possibility for us to ""check"" a valid ticket (making it invalid)
- Possibility for us to extract all the metada from all the ticket easiliy
- Possibility for us to revoke a specific ticket
- Possibliity for people to buy multiple tickets and send them to other people from their team
- Possibility for us to manually add tickets last minute for special guests (think Vitalik etc)

And also:
- A very good and easy tutorial for people who are crypto noobs and come to the event just to know more about it
- Ideally a way to be inter-chain because if we publish all the tickets on Polygon, some people will complain that it's ""not a true L2"" (this is not mandatory but a bonus :p)

- UI needs to be really slick and simple (all the typical ""switch network"", or ""you don't have enough gas"" etc etc need to be handled properly because we WILL be dealing with crypto newbies :))
- This CAN'T mess up. We cannot take the risk of having a conference canceled because something went wrong with ticketing :p",2022-01-02 10:49:10+00:00,4083,1566850133

After reviewing all the options and requirements needed for making a legally compliant top-notch event, we want to inform you that we have made the difficult decision of postponing ETHBarcelona to later this year.¬†We believe that making it in summer could be the best time and we want the community to express their opinion in the following poll: https://twitter.com/eth_barcelona/status/1485749440711467015

We want ETHBarcelona to not be a traditional event but a Solarpunk festival where the community will have a deeper role. We are planning to sell sponsorships opportunities and tickets to the event using NFTs, and at the same time involve the community in the curation of the speakers, panelists, artists, creators and other important decisions to be made. 

To deliver this in a web3 manner, we require more time and help from web3 engineers, product managers, designers, artists, web3 organizations and anyone that wants to contribute in order to fulfill this vision. If you want to be part of the movement - please apply here:

After reviewing all the options and requirements needed for making a legally compliant top-notch event, we want to inform you that we have made the difficult decision of postponing ETHBarcelona to later this year.¬†We believe that making it in summer could be the best time and we want the community to express their opinion in the following poll: https://twitter.com/eth_barcelona/status/1485749440711467015

**Note:** Events happening in summer are EthCC @Paris __(July 19-21)__, Metaverse Summit @Paris __(July 16-17)__ and ETHMexicoCity @Mexico City __(Aug 19-21)__.

We want ETHBarcelona to not be a traditional event but a Solarpunk festival where the community will have a deeper role. We are planning to sell sponsorships opportunities and tickets to the event using NFTs, and at the same time involve the community in the curation of the speakers, panelists, artists, creators and other important decisions to be made. 

To deliver this in a web3 manner, we require more time and help from web3 engineers, product managers, designers, artists, web3 organizations and anyone that wants to contribute in order to fulfill this vision. If you want to be part of the movement - please apply here:

2480,787758745.0,"UST from Coinbase will not go to to Terra it will go to ETH as an ERC 20 token.

Here is the process to get it on the terra blockchain-

You first need to send your UST to a wallet whose private key/seed phrase you own like metamask. So you need to withdraw your UST from Coinbase and then send it to this metamask address.

Use bridge.terra.money to move the UST in metamask to terra blockchain.

Just sell the UST in Coinbase for something like LTC/XLM (these coins require very little transaction fees).

Send LTC/XLM to Kucoin (you can make a Kucoin account without KYC if it doesn't allow you to just use VPN while making the account).

Now sell the LTC/XLM for UST.

Withdraw UST into Terrastation.",2022-02-04 17:46:25+00:00,5022,1566850133

- Users can cross-chain assets from any EVM Chain.
- Sign cross-chain transactions without switching networks on Metamask.
- No need to have the gas token on the destination chain.
- Batch swapping and staking into 1 transaction on destination chain.

Instead of 9 interactions with 3 dapps, users can now stay on their respective chain and execute any action on the destination chain and dapp. Dapps can now go cross-chain and capture liquidity and users from any EVM chain. 

Cross-Chain Stake here: https://transferto.xyz/showcase/etherspot-klima

I also participated in the ETH Prague hackathon, so I know the ropes. Let's create a product together if you like.

So what the hell is it? Quadratic Funding is the mathematically optimal way to fund public goods in a democratic community according to Gitcoin

How will we do it? With some good old-fashioned voting ü§©

üëâ¬†All wallets that hold a redeemed NFT ticket are able to cast a ballot

üëâ¬†In order to participate you should have a Polygon/Ethereum wallet with some MATIC to pay for the transaction gas + a valid ballot key

üëâ¬†Note: a small amount of MATIC will be airdropped to all NFT ticket holders

üëâ¬†We will send your MACI key via email, which is needed to submit the ballot

Vote based on priority! You can cast multiple votes & here‚Äôs where the ‚ú®quadratic ‚ú®¬†bit comes in! Voting for a project will cost the square of the number of votes you want to cast e.g. 1 vote costs 1 voice credit; 2 votes cost 4 credits; 5 votes cost 25 credits and so on.

Get to know the recipients of these funds and vote based on priority picks! Give projects you LOVE more credits, so they have a better chance to secure more funding ü§ë¬†Want to sign up to GET FUNDS? There‚Äôs no time to lose! Submit an application here and get your chance in a NEW & dynamic funding round  üëâ¬†[https://t.ly/QBdC](https://t.ly/QBdC)",2022-06-30 18:34:39+00:00,10063,1566850133

Traders generate liquidity and volume in orderbooks and they don't receive any compensation for it, while market makers are paid thousands of dollars every month for the same job.

If you are bot-trader, day-trader, arbitrage-trader, etc. you can have a NEW revenue stream, reducing your risk at trading.

On that note, in case you have a unique Web3 project that needs to be developed, but you're missing a dedicated team to work on your product(s) - visit the Locastic booth, and we can talk it through, or you can simply grab some swag - that's fine too, at least we won't have to carry it on a plane. üòÑ

We are all building pieces of this puzzle that will allow us to regenerate and believe in abundance. It‚Äôs time to put all the pieces together!!

Our mission at CFC is to create marketplace for open source clinical trial data without patents by using IP-NFTs Pay-For-Success (PFS) smart contracts and crowdfunded Medical Impact Certificates to incentivise repurposing of generic drugs, nutraceuticals, plant medicines & psychedelics, diets and lifestyle interventions. We plan to launch as an Impact DAO to de-risk early stage research and Public Good Pharma company using PFS contracts to get regulatory approval and bring these products to market. A $50-100m incentive can create a drug worth over $1b eg repurposing fluvoxamine to treat covid or generic ketamine or psilocybin to treat major depression.

This one is for all the web3 conference goers and speakers amongst us!

I‚Äôve been working on an app, WAGMI Guide, that will essentially mean the end of endless web3 and crypto related events spreadsheets. 

The app features all web3 events, side events, meet-ups and private gatherings around the world. It will also act as a directory for speakers, showing where they‚Äôre due to talk and enable them to share content with their followers. 

Users will also be able to network in the app, and the best part is that you‚Äôll be rewarded with perks along the way (free tickets to conferences, unlocking special features, merchandise etc.)

I know many of you have spoken at a conference in the past. If you have, please feel free to fill in the following form and your profile will be included in the app when it launches soon‚Ä¶ https://9wx6twk78a7.typeform.com/to/Om6Cgrs5

We are doing a podcast now. It is called ""Hard Fork Live"" and it aims to be a radically new way of learning about blockchain.

In the first episode, we dive deep into transitioning from web2 to web3 for developers. For web2 developers wanting to enter web3 is not usually the easiest path. There are a lot of new concepts to learn, and also new mindsets need to be adopted. In this episode, we dive deep into this topic and talk about the best approach, tools and mindset you need to start building in web3.

How to choose the right blockchain or its scaling solution for your web3 project?

For many projects, ""low cost of transactions"" or ""access to grants/hype"" from the community around a chain could be defining factors; but there are other critical aspects like ""decentralization"", ""security"", ""ease of development"" and ""maintenance costs"" which can make or break a project more in the long-run. We'll analyze these factors from a practical perspective and help you make a better decision for your project.

2Ô∏è‚É£Focused on the humans and the culture that we are creating and how we are using these tools to address issues like climate change, inequality, and social justice.
3Ô∏è‚É£Innovative as we used web3 ticketing with NFTs and each sale contributed to a pool which was later managed by the participants of the event with the use of Quadratic Voting.
4Ô∏è‚É£Environmentally friendly, by being plastic-free and offsetting our carbon footprint.
5Ô∏è‚É£Inclusive as with every ticket sold, we provided a free ticket to a student or someone who couldn't afford it.
6Ô∏è‚É£In addition to the traditional conference activities, we also had co-working spaces and other areas for attendees to experience yoga, mindfulness, and sound healing. Music and art were as well at the center of the event.

It was so inspiring to see so many diverse humans from all over the world coming together to the first edition of an Ethereum event with such a strong emphasis on using technology for good.

1. we notice a lack of understanding of web3 in the Hispanic community, this is because most of the information can be found in english, so the language barrier makes it difficult for people who don‚Äôt speak the language to become early adopters of Blockchain Technology. 
2. We also recognize the little participation of women in big blockchain events and hackathons held in english across the Globe and in the Hispanic community, thus the gender gap keeps getting bigger.

We want to thank you all for being part of our communityüíú
Without you, it wouldn't have been such a rich experience for all of us.

In 2022 ETHBarcelona was:

1Ô∏è‚É£The first Ethereum event in Spain and the largest in all of Europe with over 2200 attendees.
2Ô∏è‚É£Focused on the humans and the culture that we are creating and how we are using these tools to address issues like climate change, inequality, and social justice.
3Ô∏è‚É£Innovative as we used web3 ticketing with NFTs and each sale contributed to a pool which was later managed by the participants of the event with the use of Quadratic Voting.
4Ô∏è‚É£Environmentally friendly, by being plastic-free and offsetting our carbon footprint.
5Ô∏è‚É£Inclusive as with every ticket sold, we provided a free ticket to a student or someone who couldn't afford it.
6Ô∏è‚É£In addition to the traditional conference activities, we also had co-working spaces and other areas for attendees to experience yoga, mindfulness, and sound healing. Music and art were as well at the center of the event.

It was so inspiring to see so many diverse humans from all over the world coming together to the first edition of an Ethereum event with such a strong emphasis on using technology for good. 

We can‚Äôt wait for the second edition of this magical experience that will happen on July 5-7 in the beautiful city of Barcelona.

Without you, it wouldn't have been such a rich experience for all of us.

In 2022 ETHBarcelona was:

1Ô∏è‚É£The first Ethereum event in Spain and the largest in all of Europe with over 2200 attendees.
2Ô∏è‚É£Focused on the humans and the culture that we are creating and how we are using these tools to address issues like climate change, inequality, and social justice.
3Ô∏è‚É£Innovative as we used web3 ticketing with NFTs and each sale contributed to a pool which was later managed by the participants of the event with the use of Quadratic Voting.
4Ô∏è‚É£Environmentally friendly, by being plastic-free and offsetting our carbon footprint.
5Ô∏è‚É£Inclusive as with every ticket sold, we provided a free ticket to a student or someone who couldn't afford it.
6Ô∏è‚É£In addition to the traditional conference activities, we also had co-working spaces and other areas for attendees to experience yoga, mindfulness, and sound healing. Music and art were as well at the center of the event.

It was so inspiring to see so many diverse humans from all over the world coming together to the first edition of an Ethereum event with such a strong emphasis on using technology for good. 

We can‚Äôt wait for the second edition of this magical experience that will happen on July 5-7 in the beautiful city of Barcelona.

We want to thank you all for being part of our communityüíú
Without you, it wouldn't have been such a rich experience for all of us.

In 2022 ETHBarcelona was:

1Ô∏è‚É£The first Ethereum event in Spain and the largest in all of Europe with over 2200 attendees.
2Ô∏è‚É£Focused on the humans and the culture that we are creating and how we are using these tools to address issues like climate change, inequality, and social justice.
3Ô∏è‚É£Innovative as we used web3 ticketing with NFTs and each sale contributed to a pool which was later managed by the participants of the event with the use of Quadratic Voting.
4Ô∏è‚É£Environmentally friendly, by being plastic-free and offsetting our carbon footprint.
5Ô∏è‚É£Inclusive as with every ticket sold, we provided a free ticket to a student or someone who couldn't afford it.
6Ô∏è‚É£In addition to the traditional conference activities, we also had co-working spaces and other areas for attendees to experience yoga, mindfulness, and sound healing. Music and art were as well at the center of the event.

It was so inspiring to see so many diverse humans from all over the world coming together to the first edition of an Ethereum event with such a strong emphasis on using technology for good. 

We can‚Äôt wait for the second edition of this magical experience that will happen on July 5-7 in the beautiful city of Barcelona.

Without you, it wouldn't have been such a rich experience for all of us.

In 2022 ETHBarcelona was:

1Ô∏è‚É£The first Ethereum event in Spain and the largest in all of Europe with over 2200 attendees.
2Ô∏è‚É£Focused on the humans and the culture that we are creating and how we are using these tools to address issues like climate change, inequality, and social justice.
3Ô∏è‚É£Innovative as we used web3 ticketing with NFTs and each sale contributed to a pool which was later managed by the participants of the event with the use of Quadratic Voting.
4Ô∏è‚É£Environmentally friendly, by being plastic-free and offsetting our carbon footprint.
5Ô∏è‚É£Inclusive as with every ticket sold, we provided a free ticket to a student or someone who couldn't afford it.
6Ô∏è‚É£In addition to the traditional conference activities, we also had co-working spaces and other areas for attendees to experience yoga, mindfulness, and sound healing. Music and art were as well at the center of the event.

It was so inspiring to see so many diverse humans from all over the world coming together to the first edition of an Ethereum event with such a strong emphasis on using technology for good. 

We can‚Äôt wait for the second edition of this magical experience that will happen on July 5-7 in the beautiful city of Barcelona.

We want to thank you all for being part of our communityüíú
Without you, it wouldn't have been such a rich experience for all of us.

In 2022 ETHBarcelona was:

1Ô∏è‚É£The first Ethereum event in Spain and the largest in all of Europe with over 2200 attendees.
2Ô∏è‚É£Focused on the humans and the culture that we are creating and how we are using these tools to address issues like climate change, inequality, and social justice.
3Ô∏è‚É£Innovative as we used web3 ticketing with NFTs and each sale contributed to a pool which was later managed by the participants of the event with the use of Quadratic Voting.
4Ô∏è‚É£Environmentally friendly, by being plastic-free and offsetting our carbon footprint.
5Ô∏è‚É£Inclusive as with every ticket sold, we provided a free ticket to a student or someone who couldn't afford it.
6Ô∏è‚É£In addition to the traditional conference activities, we also had co-working spaces and other areas for attendees to experience yoga, mindfulness, and sound healing. Music and art were as well at the center of the event.

It was so inspiring to see so many diverse humans from all over the world coming together to the first edition of an Ethereum event with such a strong emphasis on using technology for good. 

We can‚Äôt wait for the second edition of this magical experience that will happen on July 5-7 in the beautiful city of Barcelona.

The other end of the deal is that participants who complete Quests will be able to earn some hella cool prizes.

It was a great success during ETH Denver so we're firing it up again. üèé

Our high level goal is to leverage the power of the attending orgs and conference goers alike to leave the city of Barcelona a bit better than when we found it. ‚ú®

**We are looking two things:

**1. Locals who have leads on excellent non-profits or grassroots orgs who are in need of some extra exposure and/or assistance and might be down to receive crypto donations.

2. Organizations that are attending ETH Barcelona and would like to get involved somehow, with preferably cool prize contributions, or even as simple as boosting the reach of our initiative.

Any questions please fire away or reach out personally!",2023-05-29 20:10:06+00:00,15816,1566850133

This is Blocto, and we are thrilled to share some exciting news with you! We'll be hosting an engaging online panel called the ER-See You 4337 Series, tailored for developers and builders! Mark your calendars for June 1st at 17:30 (UTC+8)!

In Ep.2 of this event, we will have the privilege of having Himanshu Retarekar, Co-Founder and CEO of Obviousto and John Rising, Co-founder of Stackup to share their insights, thoughts, and experiences. Together, we'll discuss how Account Abstraction is affecting the Web3 world from infra to the end users. Our main goal is to spread awareness about ERC-4337 and emphasize its significance in our Web3 society.

Also, we would greatly appreciate your support in spreading the word about this event. Help us reach a wider audience by retweeting our tweet and sharing the news with your network. Together, we can create a ripple effect of awareness and engagement within the developer community.

Thank you in advance for your support, and we look forward to your active participation in the ER-See You 4337 Series!

If your concern is still regarding how some people received tickets for free, we will continue supporting students and people with low resources as we are trying to be inclusive.

3. Esas mismas salas, despu√©s de las charlas se reutilizaban, ya sea para poner m√°s mesas, para alguna actividad (como yoga por la ma√±ana), o una de ellas ten√≠a peque√±as colchonetas donde poder dormir
4. No era obligatorio estar en el venue, pero es aconsejable por las charlas y las comidas gratis
5. Cada quien pod√≠a irse a su hotel cuando quisiera
6. La fecha l√≠mite para enviar el proyecto en el que hab√≠as trabajado era hasta el domingo a las 9 am
7. Despu√©s de entregar tu proyecto, se abre la sesi√≥n de presentar tu proyecto, tanto a los jurados principales, como a cada uno de los sponsors que hay√°is elegido para el proyecto. No era obligatorio que lo presente todo el equipo, con que est√© al menos uno, bastaba. Aunque es recomendable que est√©n todos.
8. A las 13:00 acabaron las presentaciones a los jurados y se decid√≠an los ganadores. A las 15:30 los anunciaron junto con el cierre del evento

Timeswap is the first fully permissionless, oracle-less, and non-liquidatable lending & borrowing protocol. Borrow or lend ERC-20 tokens with fixed maturity using collateral. Enjoy hassle-free maintenance and no liquidations.

Frontend Bug Discovered üêõ:
During the process of claiming our lent position in the PlsARB/USDC pool, we encountered an issue. The claim amount was not loading as expected, and we were unable to claim our position. üß™

How We Found the Bug üêõ:
We utilized the #AdvanceTime feature of BuildBear, which allowed us to fast-forward time to Pool Maturity. This helped us identify the issue.
Without this feature of BuildBear, we would have never identified the issue.

Hello Frens. I wanted to let anyone interested in fine art know that i am so excited to share that I am now representing some of the biggest artists and their works exclusively. Some of these are the biggest sellers in Maddox and Clarendon Gallery. Others incorporate AI into physical prices. 

We are not a gallery as we lead with preserving the cultural narrative of art in a bespoke, affordable and stylish way. 

I‚Äôm increasingly getting involved with as many gallery openings and events as possible. Anybody who has recommendations or would like to join me in London, are most welcome. Up for networking, talking about art and making memories too! 

Some of you know that I was involved in the NFT space as a music artist having headlined NFT.London and spoken on the panel at Dolby. I needed to take a step back from web3 and refocus my creative values so have since branched into fine art and AI. 

I‚Äôm from SW London and am free most of the time to go to events. Anyone looking to join me, please do reach out. Equally if you‚Äôre interested in works- we ship worldwide 

Feel free to browse my new site which shares a little more on what I‚Äôve been up to: https://www.hannahbloom.agency

Hannah.",2023-06-14 13:14:44+00:00,16365,1566850133

A bit off topic but if anyone is planning or would like go to Ibiza maybe after ETHBCN or ETHCC please feel free to reach out, my flat will be available for some weeks during July - August. It isn‚Äôt a party place tho but good to work remotely. 

If you are already planning to come and need a good contact to rent a Villa, boat, car, hit the night clubs, etc etc. I can connect you with good people that can help. Sadly the island is full of scammers so better to know the right people here.

Other than that, ping me if you do. I like visitors‚Ä¶ üòÄ

(Yes, I‚Äôll be copy-pasting this message in other of the groups swell) 

FAQ: is the island expensive? Yes, very but I can help you with some hacks.

Do they take crypto? Not really but I do üôÇ

Will you get a POAP if you come? I just thought about it so maybe. 

Are there any side events? Not sponsored  but open to ideas and suggestions. 

Do I realized this message is way too long? Yes, but I‚Äôm typing it during a flight and I‚Äôm bored (I might edit later)",2023-06-20 20:00:22+00:00,16741,1566850133

This Saturday, we will be hosting a Space at Crypto Musica Classic dedicated to the Hackathon of ETH Barcelona with the Criptonicas team. If you're interested in joining the panel, please send a DM from now till 7pm CEST today!

Crypto Musica Classic is a radio space music show that has been running since 2021. We have a good vibe and play great music NFT and web 3 vibe. During the show, we will talk about the Hackathon at ETH Barcelona, and it would be nice if some of the participants could come and talk about their story and how they feel about what's coming!

We will launch communication today.

10937,1663079955.0,"Hola a todos!
I just booked my flight and I'm super excited to be returning to one of my favorite cities to hack on ETH! I'm looking to join or form a team. I have a proven record of success winning bounties at ETH hackathons including: ETH LIsbon, ETH SF and Graph Hack. Most of my experience is on the application side working as a SWE for web2 companies like Docker and Reddit primarily with Node.js, TypeScript and React. I've been doing a lot of Solidity lately and would love the chance to do work on the protocol side as well.
Please don't hesitate to reach out and DM me if you're looking to form a team or need more engineering support on your team.

We are organizing a virtual roundtable focused on grants, treasury, and support. This free event, hosted by Parity and 1inch, is designed to facilitate a cross-ecosystem exchange of experiences related to project support.

In addition to Parity and 1inch, we will have speakers from Lido, w3f, SAFE, Dfinity, and Karpatkey discussing topics such as team selection, different forms of project support (both monetary and non-monetary), and the dynamics between VC and treasury operations. We already have attendees from various projects like Polygon, Aragon, Astar, Blockscout, Just Open Source, VIA, Gearbox, and more.

We would be delighted to invite members of ecosystems or ecosystem builders to participate in the conference. To express your interest in participating, please apply to the waitlist at the following link: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/667365286537/

Let's build a simple notification tool that will send notifications when the price of a cryptocurrency goes above or below a certain level. It's as simple as that!

While there are existing products in the market that offer similar functionality, there is still plenty of room for improvements. Let's meet up and hack together!",2023-07-05 07:48:08+00:00,18173,1566850133

Hey guys! It's Tony. Who wants to join my team as a developer for the hackathon?

Let's build a simple notification tool that will send notifications when the price of a cryptocurrency goes above or below a certain level. Sounds simple, right?

While there are existing products in the market that offer similar functionality, there is still plenty of room for improvements. 
THERE IS MORE THAN THAT, it is not about notifications only‚Ä¶

I am planning to continue to develop it after the hackhathon and  test it on the real market/customers.

This workshop is here to help you align your passions with the endless possibilities of the crypto space. Expect to meet both new and expert web3 explorers, sharing fresh inspiration and timeless wisdom. Let's find your web3 calling.

Bonus questions to meditate on:
- What part of web3 calls you?
- What value so you want to offer web3?
- What would you like to gain from web3?

There are only 40 places available, so make sure to show up early if you want to blaze new trails with us!
