As you may have noticed, we're getting an update.

Not only a simple update though... we are bringing onboard one of the most accurate and beastly traders from Italy. For security we will not say his name, but he will be known as The Sicilian from now on. 

He called the Bitcoin bottom at 3,500 (when everyone was desperate to sell). And he made his own fortune shorting XRP on every pump and dump since 2019. In other words, we are lucky to have him in... and he will be managing our trades from now on.

As his first measure, we are changing of trading platform (for both Margin and Alts) to ByBit and Binance respectively.

REGISTER WITH THE LINKS BELOW TO GET A LIFETIME DISCOUNT ON COMISSIONS

And as his second measure we are changing our trading signal format to a simpler and more understandable one.

We are making Bitcoin Bullets® GREAT AGAIN🔥🔥🔥

➖➖➖➖➖
**TECHNICAL**
$BTC is currently starting with Low Time Frame bullish momentum, probably indicating some more upside later in the day. Closing above 40,800 on the Daily would mean breaking our ATH and probably heading towards 50,000

**SENTIMENT**
People starting to talk more about $BTC on social media (specially on twitter) and gaining traction with people who didn't know about crypto before. Elon Musk is doing a great job holding this momentum and building people's trust in Bitcoin.

**FUNDAMENTS**
As we all know not all cryptocurrencies will become something great, in fact most of them will likely go to $0, but a couple of big players including $BTC and $ETH will become the currency of the future. Saying that a Satoshi could sometime in the future be worth one cent or even $1 is not far from reality.

Our team at Bitcoin Bullets is the only one in the world that combines areas such as coding, technical analysis, sentiment analysis and correlation with other markets in its day to day activities.

Why? 

Because once in a while a beast is born from combining all these... and in this particular case we have given birth to the biggest beast of all: The Bullet Bot.

What can it do?

It doesn't just analyze charts and sentiment separately, it combines both and by adding averaging formulas and volatility indexes, it creates a predicted daily range (price limits), automatic scalp entry points (derived from Fibonacci sequencing) and determines an intra day direction for the market as a whole.

The best part? It will make our VIPs fucking rich. You're welcome guys.

Sincerely,

We have broken above our 51,256 level. If 4H closes remain above this level we can expect stronger continuation at least to 53,000 - If we break below this level and close on 4H then we should head to 48,000 and 46,000 as retest levels.

Telegram channels are everywhere telling their members it's the top, opening high leverage shorts on both BTC and ETH, and trying to be the ones who ""guessed it"". To us, this is the perfect recipe for one more push up (53,000 - 55,000) before the real drop.

Short term sentiment in this market is defined by short term movement so even if we have an overall Bullish sentiment with BTC right now, it will for sure be a Bearish sentiment day, at least until we regain strength ad momentum to reach higher

Technically, we have reached most downside liquidity for BTC (donw to our $47,851.5 key level, which has liquidated most over-leveraged longs and gave BTC enough strength to bounce back up. Closing above $52,000 on the 4H, will mean we are likely heading back up to our ATH

We are currently ranging (with no consistent closes above or below) between our $52,700 and $50,700 levels. (See the black arrow and how price perfectly respects our key levels)

For now we have two options: 

Scenario 1) We close on 4H below $50,700. This would mean we are likely continuing down to at least our next mid term support around $47,800. (closing all our longs in profit). 

Scenario 2) We close on 4H above $52,700. We are still mid term bullish and likely heading to our ATH (and breaking it)

Heavily ranging below our $47,886 resistance, meaning we are likely heading down later in the day. We are watching out for suspicious market activity which can many times throw all technicals through the window and go the complete opposite way.

Sentiment has changed from pessimism to optimistic suspense in the last couple of days. Ranging above $45,000 has made most people believe we are not done yet. And this can be the main reason why a slight outbreak could take us back towards our ATH and above.

Feb. 28- 2021
➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Approaching our strongest support level. We expect price to reach it in the next couple of hours. Technically, this is the dip everyone was talking about... the only problem is that most got REKT thinking the dip would be much smaller. Our VIPs and The Sicilian knew we were going to reach this level since reaching our ATH.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment has made a hole on the ground. People are thinking BTC is a Ponzi again and that we are going to 0. What can this mean? That we have reached our buy zone. This is crypto Black Friday so get your hands on as much spot buys as you want.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Just as The Sicilian told our VIPs... Triple bottom played out perfectly sending BTC from $43,000 to $49,000. Closing our 4H candle above $48,500 would be extremely bullish and would send us directly to $54,000 and probably higher

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
One day after sentiment reached it's monthly low, we pump 15%. Not a coincidence and not a secret for our VIPs. When sentiment is at its lowest, it's time to be buying, and that's exactly what we were doing.

Ranging above support, our main resistance level now lies above $52,000 where we could be heading next if BTC manages to gain strength and maintain momentum. If sellers manage to take control and push price below $48,000 we can easily expect a retest of $41,000.

**Bitcoin Bullets® Market Analysis**
March 7- 2021
➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC is currently facing one of its strongest mid term resistance levels, $51,500 that if broken, should take us straight to $58,500 in a window of no more than 7 days. However, if this resistance level is rejected, and BTC begins showing weakness, we could vey much see $47,150 next.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment has dramatically increased from the last few days reaching a new weekly high. This doesn't mean that we are heading down, but it does give us a reason to be careful. Sentiment can always increase, no matter how high it gets.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
We can clearly see an HTF ascending triangle forming on BTC. Probability wise, it should break down, as a continuation patters. However, we all know BTC likes to do whatever it wants to, so if we do break down, we will catch the move on confirmation.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
BTC sentiment remaining pretty much the same while alt sentiment has dramatically increased. This could clearly be the beginning of an all new alt season. VIPs already know what to do.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Ranging between our strongest local support at $52,735 and our strongest all-time resistance ($58,500) BTC is showing exceptional strength and looks like today we're heading towards our ATH. In case we break our ATH there's nothing stopping us from $63,000.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment has reached a new monthly high, indicating many new buyers are entering the market. This could give shorters a squeeze pushing price even higher. We can absolutely see why there will be many sellers around $58,500 trying to get their initial investment back.

Pretty much maintaining our previous range. For now we can expect wither of two outcomes. We range here for a while and break our ATH with volumes or we retest our previous highs and dip back below $55,000 where we would likely see a spree of seller heading in.

Bang. Retested our resistance perfectly and headed down. A $3,000 move that would have made you 52% on 10x leverage. Now we remain bullish and expect a retest of our ATH in the next 24 hours. It's very likely we break through in which case we would head straight to $64,000

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment remains bullish, however, has dropped a bit from yesterday. This gives us a wider range to break the ceiling and reach new market highs. Sentiment will likely rise indiscriminately until $64,000 at which point we expect a pretty big correction.

March 14- 2021
➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC just came down a bit after a massive sell wall at $62,000 prevented our baby from heading up to our $64,000 target. Now we are ranging between our $58,500 support and our $64,000 resistance, expecting a pretty big spike in volatility after our weekly close.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Closing our Weekly candle above $60,000 will the the most bullish sign the market has ever experienced. This could easily take us to $70,000 since sentiment has once again dropped to baseline while price has remained out of this world bullish.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Higher Bitcoin supply on exchanges (specially Gemini) has played out exactly as we told you. We got out 10% drop right after we told you about that. Now what we expect is $55,300 to hold if we are short term bullish and $52,700 if we are mid term bullish. We expect a mid term break of our ATH.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment has not dropped as we could have expected from a 10%+ drop. It has remained relatively stable giving spot traders with deep pockets more reasons to quickly buy this dip.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Found support at around $54,700 after ripping over $2 Billion in lon liquidations. If this level can hold, we should retest our ATH in no more than 2 days and likely break it, reaching our $64,000 target. If we drop below $54,000 once again and range there for a while, we would be looking at a retest of $52,000 next which is unlikely but can vary much happen.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment has gone though the floor once again. People think that the top is in and those who bought above $60,000 pretty much can't sleep. This is a dangerous but very advantageous scenario as we can not expect with confidence another move up.",2021-03-16 14:42:25+00:00,2439,1351499165

Ranging above our $54,700 support after several retests, meaning we are much more likely to head north than to head south before our daily close. Just as XTZ has retested its short term support and banged through to its short term resistance, we could see BTC reach at least $57,500. 

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Even though sentiment has not dramatically increased since our previous analysis, we can observe how buyers are on its majority expecting a push to the upside.

Just as we expected and told you it would happen yesterday, BTC has broken its mid term $57,500 resistance turning it into support. This is where we should expect BTC price action to turn around if we really expect to remain short term bullish.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC is technically extremely strong short term and has an 80%+ probability of continuing up and breaking its previous ATH. On the other hand, we can never rule out a small downside probability that would take up back to a $57,000 retest in the bes of cases and a $52,000 in the worst of them.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment has remained stable, even though BTC has reached its last $58,500 ATH and is calmly ranging around it. This can only mean that we still have a very big space to move up before considerable downside.

ETH has surely been behaving as a rebel teen. Doing whatever it wants without giving a fuck about what BTC does. This means we are likely getting a larger divergence between these two big players over time.

Independently, ETH looks like it could have a short term dive down to its 1670 short term support level before reaching (and breaking) its ATH at 2050.

Nobody will place a single short order there, because even if an ATH is a ""resistance"" level, it's also a liquidation level, where new shorts have placed their Stop Losses, making a tiny break of tis level become a huge new ATH.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC has broken and closed below our mid term $57,500 support level signaling the market should go ""down"" short term. We believe this is not currently the case and that even if we get one final small dip, BTC will head up again to its ATH en break higher above. Let's see how the official trading week starts tomorrow.",2021-03-21 16:21:55+00:00,2470,1351499165

As always, weekend sentiment is surrounded by uncertainty and much more having in account that we've got a pretty decent drop from our weekly highs. People who bought BTC above $60,000 and ETH above $2,000 are currently in a position where fear is pretty much everything they have. They will make their money back and make a killing if they're strong enough to hold tight

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC has been respecting its trend-line support for the last couple of days making it one of our most important reference points to analyze price action. If BTC manages to break and close above $59,600 on the 4H, this trend-line support would be invalidated as we would be heading once again to a new ATH. If this trend-line support breaks to the downside, however, we can expect to touch our $52,500 support once again before determining our next move.",2021-03-22 16:06:51+00:00,2475,1351499165

Sentiment has dramatically increased after the weekend for two main reasons: 1) Official trading week has now started and no astronomical downside has been registered for BTC or any other big player and 2) BTC dominance has sharply dropped below 60% making our alt-coin picks pop. This is what we've been telling you for so long...

BTC moved perfectly as we expected, making our VIP bullets two extremely profitable trades with perfect entries (BTC and ETH longs). For now we can see our strongest resistance around $57,500 where we will likely have a slightly hard time crossing but should break through after 1 or 2 tests. Strongest support is now $52,500 where we're probably not heading before $57,500",2021-03-23 13:50:15+00:00,2484,1351499165

Sentiment has started off the week as a fucking roller coaster. Even though we've dropped about 8% yesterday and both big and small players have bled pretty seriously, sentiment remains overall positive. This is because we're never really become bearish, and because every single short term support level has held with relative strength

Bang. We told you yesterday we had caught another short term bottom for BTC. Our long positions is balls deep in profit and should hit higher targets if BTC holds strong above $56,000. Our main resistance point now rests at $58,300 which if broken, would take us straight to $64,000

BOOOM. While everyone else thought BTC was dying and while every other channel was shorting the bottom, we were grabbing ourselves the juiciest ever long positions. BTC has broken above its previous resistance level ($52,500, Our most important long term level) and retested it as support. We are now likely heading straight to $57,520 where one of our strongest resistance levels rests.",2021-03-26 15:48:02+00:00,2520,1351499165
1535,-1001351499165,"⚪️SENTIMENT
That's why we have the best sentiment analysis system in the market, because ewe combine sentiment data with technical analysis before making any market decision. Technically, yesterday BTC would have headed straight dow to sub $48,000 levels, however sentiment was telling us a whole different story. Nobody else does this, and that's what makes us the best.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC broke up exactly as we told you it would... reaching a high of $55,600. It's now holding very strong on both shorter and longer time frames, printing a very concise bull-flag that rarely fails. This means our next level for BTC is very likely $57,500 which should be reached this weekend. As for downside potential, it's there but it's extremely tiny.",2021-03-27 14:28:41+00:00,2531,1351499165

Sentiment has been increasing even if BC hasn't broken new highs. Why? Because BTC dominance is falling, total market cap rising and alt coins are exploding. This means that our alt season is likely starting a month late... but should be the strongest market move we've ever seen...

Boom. Most of the market shorting while we were longing the fuck out of BTC, LTC, ETH and LINK. We can expect a bullish continuation that drives price up to our next key resistance at $57,500 and eventually up to $64,000. As for our support levels, we should watch out for $54,750 and $52,700 for possible retests.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment once again increasing as new buyers enter the market and alt-coins start booming. We can expect this trend to continue up to our ATH. Sentiment is an extremely reliable tool few channels and traders use, a tool that has made us millions.

Once again sentiment skyrocketing as our official trading weeks has kicked off with a strength we rarely see in this market. If sentiment keeps rising the way it has been doing for the last 3-4 days, we can easily expect a $10,000 rise in BTC and a total increase of ~15-20% in market capitalization. All this before a massive sell-off like the one we had in 2017.

Well just as we told you yesterday, BTC broke yet another mid term resistance level ($58,323) like a hot knife cuts through butter.

Once in a while when we reach new weekly highs, people just turn sentiment around and decide the ""top is in"". This makes for a perfect spot holding and margin longing scenario as these emotional shorters are generally over leveraged and the market will inevitably head against those positions to liquidate them

We have just readjusted our levels for BTC. After hours sitting with The Sicilian analyzing every possible key support and resistance level for BTC, and identifying its new mid term invisible resistance level we've come to the conclusion that we're very likely heading to a new ATH this week.

When market price action remains pretty much the same for more than a day, people generally become anxious and scared. They start to think they bought the ""top"" and that any short term drop is a selling indicator. It's these traders who make those ass-fucking wicks possible.

BTC just broke its previous high range boundary and closed above it on Higher Time Frames signaling short term market strength. Just as ETH broke its ATH and reached a high of almost $2100, we expect BTC to break to the upside and reach a high of at least $64,000 as we've been telling you for weeks.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment has slowly been building up again, signaling we could see a final market push before we officially enter our low-volume trading weekend. This push may take BTC to a new high of $64,000 or up to $67,000 if the bullish momentum goes into beast mode.

Our short term range has been holding price action perfectly for way too long now. Our official trading week has closed with a tremendous lack of volatility we are not used to with BTC, specially in a strong trending market. We can easily expect a small volatility to to either push price above $62,000 or below $57,000 in no time. The likely scenario for now remains bullish.",2021-04-03 13:29:19+00:00,2591,1351499165

As with every strong trending market, the highest volatility can be seen in sentiment as it quickly reaches a peak before plateauing with any short term price action range. Until we break above our ATH or below our $57,000 lower limit, we can expect sentiment to remain pretty much the same.

Sentiment exploded. We've pretty much never seen such an increase on a Monday after a move of just $2,000. This can mean people are becoming ready to purchase spot and that a higher cash liquidity in the market will inevitably drive price up again to our highs. Remember sentiment is a very useful tool if you know how to use it, and that it can ALWAYS increase, no matter how high it gets.

BTC has broken down on lower time frames jus as we told you it would yesterday. It's however, still trading above our most important short term S/R flip: $57,500 which has been strongly rejected by buyers in lower time frames. It's very likely we head down a bit more before reaching new highs, our main support levels for this mid term reversal are $54,750 and $52,500.",2021-04-06 16:37:39+00:00,2616,1351499165

The two brothers who hate each other, not accepting they come from the same parents... Fear and Greed. Greed was at its peak yesterday, making FOMO buyers open high leverage positions which are likely going to be liquidated. Now, after a very short term drop, Fear of Losing has claimed most short term traders. It's just a matter of time for this to reverse as well.

BTC has broken once again above its $58,000 resistance level and it's fighting very hard to retest it as support. Price action is currently looking weak, and could very likely have another drop before mid term bullish continuation. The main support levels we are watching now are $55,300 and $54,000.

BTC respects our Sicilian boundaries as if its family depended on it...

We are currently ranging just below its trend-line resistance around $61,200 which it can't break and close above just now. 

We can retest our lower boundary once again (as low as $55,000) but we will eventually break to the upside, not only reaching a new All Time High, but very likely reaching $67,000 - our new mid term target.

Our VIPs will know exactly what to do.

BOOM. What did we tell you yesterday just before breaking our All Time High? That's correct, that it would happen in less than a day. No we have reached our $63,000 target and BTC is looking stronger than ever. If bullish momentum keeps on building up, we can expect a $64,600 pit stop before reaching $67,000. In the low probability scenario of breaking down, we would go for a $58,900 retest before continuation.",2021-04-13 15:34:15+00:00,2663,1351499165

That's what we've been telling you for weeks, once sentiment starts building up in any direction, it's nearly impossible to stop it. Bullish sentiment has destroyed every single resistance and looks like it has some more space to move up before halting and correcting. Judging by sentiment along, we probably have 40-50% more space to move up.

We're very likely reaching a local top here. Bulls are pretty much market FOMO longers and this last push was caused by hype around the new Coinbase IPO, which has absolutely 0 real impact in Bitcoin fundamentals. We could have one last push to $67,000 however everything is indicating that for now we'll not break our current ATH and will head down from here. The main support level we should be looking to is $61,900.",2021-04-14 17:25:29+00:00,2668,1351499165

Sentiment is now at an All Time High. Absolutely no reasoning for it to be this high, right where we were at our 2017 highs. Even though we can be wrong and this is not a signal to 10x short BTC with your entire balance, it's very likely we now reset our short term (or even mid term) sentiment.

Looking short term bearish judging by lower time frames (15m, 1h). Just as we told you it would, BTC is taking the out the swimsuit and the sunscreen because it's going for a short term dive. Even though we don't expect this dive to get us below $60,500, we can very much see this as a spot buying opportunity aiming at our next target: $67,000

Currently looking like we've found a short term bottom, BTC is holding very strong above our mid term support of $60,420.

We're fucking back... The Sicilian is fucking back... BITCOIN BULLETS is fucking back, and we’re ready to take this market by the balls. Currently looking like BTC is heading for a quick dive that if not completely bought back up around our local lows of $52,500 we're heading down to $50,200 and eventually to $47,200. If bulls manage to step in and give the market some momentum, we're heading for a $57,520 retest before determining our next move.",2021-04-22 17:42:23+00:00,2707,1351499165

For the last 5 days, BTC and overall market sentiment has been a rollercoaster. Dropping to yearly lows on Sunday after our 20% crash and now rising once again to monthly highs after ETH broke its $2,500 All Time High and BTC remaining in range instead of completely imploding.

BTC is only closing on a symmetrical triangle what will end up being one of the largest volatility spikes we've ever seen. We currently have a much higher chance of breaking down, and reaching our $47,700 support once again before heading back up. Too many traders have their stops places below that swing low meaning it's the most reasonable move to clear them our first before moving back up.",2021-04-25 17:31:28+00:00,2719,1351499165

Well, looks like The Sicilian has trained BTC to do whatever the fuck he wants. We knew BTC has breaking its $55,000 resistance, we just didn't expect it to happen this fast. It's now ranging above this resistance (now support) lever with great bullish momentum, meaning we can potentially reach a high of $56,500 today.",2021-04-30 14:58:20+00:00,2759,1351499165

Sentiment picking up from that $52,500 drop we had less than 24 hours ago, once again reaching weekly highs. We've never been in a bear market, it was all a mid term correction meant to take all of us to new highs. Sentiment still has space to move up.

Destroyed its previous ATH and currently holding a $2,960.35 high on bybit with strength. 

The Sicilian told you we were going to reach $3,000 in no more than a month about a month ago when we were ranging at out monthly lows. Now we're around 120% up and likely breaking our $3,000 mark to reach even higher highs.

After reaching a new mid term high of $58,570, which means an $11,000 increase from our $47,000 long zone, we're likely heading for a short term correction which shouldn't reach down lower than $53,950 and where we expect a very strong bullish reaction.

Sentiment has also reached a mid term high when topping at around $58,570 supporting the argument of a short term correction to reset this sentiment. Our $53,950 is perfectly confluent with a neutral sentiment and a mid term reset which would very likely take us to new local highs.

Boom. And just as we told you yesterday on our BTC update, that drop below $53,500 was just a short term fake-out, where our VIP orders were just getting filled before heading up again to our targets. We've gained enough short term bullish momentum meaning we can very easily break our previous short term swing high at $59,000 today.",2021-05-05 16:38:38+00:00,2799,1351499165

Sentiment has also been approaching All Time Highs thanks to ETH and DOGE which by themselves have added more than any other coin even to our total Market Cap. It now looks as a pretty choppy ride up, both for alts and for BTC, which is set to reach new All Time Highs.

Exactly what The Sicilian and the rest of the team expected for today. That last drop below $53,00 was just a fake-down we were expecting before a stronger move up, a move that took BTC up to $58,470 (above our key $56,500 resistance).

BTC has gained strength above $58,000 and is now looking like it will retest $59,730 (ur next mid term resistance) before our daily close.

BTC sentiment has returned to baseline after a weeklong rally and could begin moving up once again as soon as the bullish momentum we've gain starts to build up. Altcoin (specially ETH and LTC) sentiment has soared through the stratosphere as widespread adoption from late players has expanded. We are telling you for months to accumulate these... so congrats.

BTC heading to yet new weekly highs after ETH bullishness became mainstream. We are likely reaching a short/mid term top on overall market structure, meaning we're gonna start being careful about new leveraged long positions.

People are more than ever before buying into high risk positions due to hype and ambition like we've never seen before.

Short term bearish after SEC crackdown and regulation news ([Source](https://decrypt.co/70626/sec-crypto-crackdowns-top-1-7-billion-in-penalties-report)). This intraday bearish momentum could take BTC price action to a new mid term swing low, in which case we would be heading much lower. If BTC is to reach a new All Time Highs from it current price ($55,070) it must not dive below $51,850. Our VIP Insiders know what to do.",2021-05-12 17:35:25+00:00,2851,1351499165

Sentiment has floored all the way down from our weekly and monthly highs. After bearish momentum started building up on lower time frames and most alt-coins printed lower levels, traders are doubting current conditions and the possibility of a continuation rally.

Yes. The ""final bullishness"" The Sicilian was talking about took us to a new high of almost $4,400. What a move everyone🔥

Now that ETH and closely linked alts are remaining stable against BTC, we could see one final extension before a very major correction. This is NOT the time to be buying ETH, the time was a month ago when we couldn't get tired of telling you to FUCKING BUY.

Reached a $45,805 low after plummeting more than 10% in a matter of hours. It's amazing how twitter can cause an entire market to shave off over $200 billion from one day to another. We reached a higher intraday low of $47,021 before pumping over $2,000 back above our short term $49,000 support. BTC still has some space to move down, but this will depend almost completely on sentiment and market intentions.",2021-05-13 20:28:51+00:00,2861,1351499165

Sentiment completely imploded after Elon's tweet, printing a low not seen since March. Now that we have grabbed all the liquidity below $46,000 we could either head straight up to our All Time High ($65,000) with more strength than ever before or we could dive deeper into this mid term bearish trend.

BTC hasn't retested or even got near that last $45,805 low after testing and strongly rejecting it. Now trading above support with bulls having a clear intraday advantage, we could see price head up to our currently most important resistance level in the next 3 days ($54,000). In the unlikely scenario we head below $47,000 we would be extremely bearish mid term and likely preparing to reach a low of $41,000 again.",2021-05-14 12:26:17+00:00,2867,1351499165

For spot holders there's absolutely no reason to sell at current ranges due to the fact the relative to our current market structure as a whole, price is unlikely to head down lower from here. Sentiment has dramatically increased relative to the change in price (small) and looks like it's about to pick up even stronger.

BTC becoming more and more unpredictable every second, and much more knowing we're just starting the two days with highest volatility and uncertainty of the week (Saturday and Sunday).

Sentiment is currently leaning to the bull's side as all mid term lows have been cleared out and enough upside liquidity is now present to go for our highs next. If $47,700 holds, and price action gets above $51,375 again, we will consider this a mid term bottom and we would be likely heading up again to our swing highs at $59,700 and probably to our ATH ($65,000) next.

Looking like we're about t retest $47,000 again after our short term up move to $49,808. The reaction we get from this level will determine the mid term trend of the entire market for the next 1-2 weeks. A break and close below $47,000 would confirm $43,000 as our next target. This reaction would spread an enormous amount of fear through the market likely causing further downside.",2021-05-16 15:27:18+00:00,2883,1351499165

On the other hand, is positive sentiment begins to build up from above $47,000 and we repeatedly close on 4H above this level, we would likely begin our trading week with a very strong upside momentum. In this second case, volatility would play on the bulls side and could be the start of a new ATH.

Sentiment has completely floored and looks like it still has some space to move down (confluent with that $39,150 retest). Sentiment must start to pick up once again if we expect to reach a new ATH in less than a year, because if bears take once again control of things, we'll see lows not even imagined a week ago. We need a set of extremely bullish news to move now...

Once again retesting our swing lows at $42,000 BTC is looking extremely weak short term. We it manages to break once more below this level we'll likely build up bearish momentum and head down even lower. How low? Well, we'll be looking at a potential touch of $39,152 before any chance of a serious bounce.",2021-05-18 18:28:01+00:00,2903,1351499165

Even though sentiment completely floored yesterday and [rice hasn't moved much in the last 24 hours, sentiment is starting to pick up again and regain the average strength it had before this drop. The tiny problem with sentiment it that while it's regaining some strength, it's still governed by uncertainty and doubt, making any move much more expandable than it would normally be.

The few players that have't drowned are the ones that will not only survive this market but will thrive in the next run... a move we expect will take no more than 3 days to start and could take us wither to a lower high of around $58,000 - $60,000 and break through our ATH and reach the previously expected $71,000 extension level.

BTC has become slower and slower as price action has been approaching new short term limits. Though it's unlikely to reach new mid term lows below that $29,800 low, we could head to a $32,000 - $33,000 retest in the next couple of hours before our daily close. Today's daily close will define whether we remain above $35,000 and head to new mid term highs (above $40,000) or we get down below $30,000 once again.

⚪️SENTIMENT
Although Sentiment has seen a bounce yesterday, it's still slowly grinding down as if it would be about to plummet again. The thing is that we could easily see sentiment plummet several percentage points in a matter of minutes with a tiny bearish sign (a drop to $32,000), which would make not only sentiment, but the entire market bounce with strength to and expected minimum high of $40,000",2021-05-21 20:42:54+00:00,2925,1351499165

Sentiment, on the other hand, had been dipping more and more over the last hours, signaling a possible sweep of lows (below $29,500) before the move up we're expecting Though this is very unlikely, such a move could extend down to $26,450 where it would be more than likely held by one of our strongest mid term support levels.

BTC has once again dropped below $35,000 in a bearish attempt to break below our previous $33,463 low which would either be fuel for another triple bottom and a very strong move up. The Sicilian expects one of the highest volatility spikes of the year to happen either before our weekly close (in 11 hours) or t=in the 24 hour period after it. This move will likely take us to a sweep of our current lows before a move up to $38,000 and eventually $43,500",2021-05-23 13:09:38+00:00,2935,1351499165

Just as we told you yesterday, BTC dipped to $31,000 before heading straight up to $38,600 and above our $37,500 resistance. Even though this level is currently being strongly fought off by the bears, who still want to drive price action below $30,000, we expect to se new weekly highs from here.

Sentiment has dramatically increased in the last 24 hours reaching new weekly highs and showing no signs of slowing down. Sentiment has been on a recession for way longer than it normally does signaling a very likely bullish move that will likely take over a week to complete. Even though it's very unlikely at this point, Sentiment still has a small chance of dropping to baseline again, in which case we would need to embrace ourselves to see new lows.

1942,-1001351499165,"⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Even though Sentiment is still pretty low in comparison to how it was a month ago, it's still relatively stable and has a much wider space to move up after tapping most liquidity pools below $40,000 and $30,000. If BTC manages to break $41,500 with strength, we'll see a new Sentiment spike and likely the start of a new mid term hype wave that will take both BTC and our alt picks to higher targets.

Our good old BTC is currently trading in a limbo range between our $27,000 mid term support and our $41,000 mid term resistance. Both being levels we'll likely touch in the next 10 days. Uncertainty is still king in the market, as people are afraid to re enter but are also hesitant to sell at ""The Bottom"". That's the perfect recipe for a Sicilian liquidation move we pretty much see every week in this market.",2021-05-26 13:20:01+00:00,2952,1351499165

Sentiment, as you know, either makes or breaks market structure completely, and now this carries much more relevance than in any other time in the past year. Sentiment will likely drive price action to our mid term resistance $41,000 before quickly dropping a couple of thousand dollars and stabilizing for a day or two before moving again.

BTC remaining stable with one of the lowest volatility profiles we've seen in weeks. Price action is currently respecting our upper and lower channel range boundaries to the dollar. If our next high high retest around $37,000 holds price action strong, we'll be likely breaking above $41,500 and reaching a potential high of $50,400",2021-05-27 16:27:19+00:00,2961,1351499165

BTC: Short term broke down from our ascending triangle and looking like something is stopping it from going lower. The breakdown pattern we're currently printing looks like it would be preparing Bitcoin to go much lower (judging by previous breakout/down patterns), however, it now has a different buying volume and buying intentions profile, meaning this is likely a fake-down move and we'll be getting back above $39,000 this weekend.",2021-05-28 14:46:03+00:00,2969,1351499165

Sentiment has remained stable and neutral for the last 4-5 days, giving it an ideal profile for a high volatility move either way. Even though the likely scenario for now is a break above, we still have the possibility of breaking down, which would likely be due to negative news or FUD. Our big move will happen before our weekly close, and our VIPs will be more than ready for it😉

Strong weekly close above our $34,329.5 signaling strength in the market and much more above $37,000 where we are currently ranging. Bulls must maintain price action above this level in order to head higher short term. $39,150 is our next key level, which bulls are trying hard to break above before our monthly close, which will be the most important one we've had in a very long time.",2021-05-31 22:11:39+00:00,2996,1351499165

Sentiment gradually turning more positive as buying orders pile up and buying intention increases in comparison to selling intentions. Until we don't break above that $39,150 level though, we're likely not seeing any weekly high in sentiment. The Sicilian's clock is running out, he knows something big is coming… and it's coming to us with horns at full speed.

That's exactly what The Sicilian was talking about we he was talking about having one of the most solid monthly closes in a very long while. We’ve just closed May above $37,000 which just signaled the entire market that buyers are not willing to lest price drop below this level for more than a week or two. Our sub $30,000 low (where we told you to fucking buy) will likely not be visited again anytime soon😉",2021-06-01 16:05:22+00:00,3006,1351499165

Sentiment has increased after that Monthly close 16 hours ago and looks like it will keep increasing at least the first week of June, as we enter our official northern hemisphere summer, a time when a.large portion of the market pretty much goes on vacation, leaving it much more silent than it would normally be. Bulls have an edge now, watch out of short trades and scalps which are absolutely not recommended at this time.

Trading with strength above $37,000 on our second daily candly of the month. The entire market looks like it's preparing for a breakout anytime, though it could take 24-48 hours before actually happening to shake the most traders as possible before our big move. $39,153 is currently our strongest mid term resistance, which must be broken and closed above to confirm a reversal.",2021-06-02 17:16:27+00:00,3010,1351499165
1997,-1001351499165,"⚪️**SENTIMENT**
On the other hand, $34,329.5 must be respected as support in order to maintain our current market structure and open the doors to this mid term bottom. A retest of this support level is extremely unlikely, however, it still has a 10-15% probability of happening, in which case we would increase our chances of heading even lower before a long term bullish reaction.

Broke out all of our short term resistance levels and headed straight towards our strongest mid term key resistance level at $39,150 which is currently holding price action in place without mid term breakout confirmation. Once we break this $39,150 level with volume and close above it, we will have confirmed a mid term breakout that will easily take us to $47,000",2021-06-03 18:54:01+00:00,3014,1351499165

Although Sentiment remains overall neutral, it has been tilting towards the positive die of the spectrum in the last 48 hours, signaling a slow but accelerating move towards the bull's side. This is comparable to letting a ball roll down a hill as it starts moving slowly and little by little gaining speed and momentum , accelerating until it reaches its final spot.

Sentiment decreasing after Elon's tweet, and making new intra day lows pretty much every hour. There are currently two options for sentiment, either we break above $39,000 again and confirm a bullish continuation, in which case sentiment would explode, or we break and close below $36,000 again on the 4H, which would push Sentiment even lower and would set new sentiment lows.

Sentiment has been a bitch for the last 3 days, being as uncertain as uncertain can get.

On the other hand, is Sentiment turns bullish again with a push above $39,150 we can expect to see new monthly highs in the following 3-4 days, starting with $41,540 and then to $50,468. Until we break below $30,000 (very unlikely) we remain bullish.

Once again the Sicilian was right. He predicted BTC was about to break down even before it broke below $36,000.

We know nobody will enjoy our new model, but we do expect BTC to visit 26,500 - 27,000 this week, as bears gain more momentum and strength.

From here we’re likely seeing one of the strongest bullish reactions we’ve every seen in this market, as corrections this long are uncommon and always end the same way, with a bear massacre.

Be extremely careful with long positions at this range, as not even long scalps are currently recommended. For those looking to ride this move down to $27,000, we’ll be looking at a $34,330 retest and rejection as a swing short entry point. Until then, our VIP Insiders know what to do😉

After reaching multi-weak lows, sentiment has once again picked up and reached levels comparable to those we had on our 2018 reversal, It’s now likely time for a short term support retest and a continuation that will lead up towards new weekly and monthly highs.

After a correction of over 50% it's no surprise sellers have began to get exhausted, opening the doors for bulls and for new mid term highs.

Sentiment has been gradually building up once again and could be the main argument for bears to enter the market again after the month long correction we had.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
With a consistent higher low pattern, BTC seems to have gained a bit of strength between Friday and today. There's no mid term move confirmation just yet meaning that there's no clear upside or downside advantage as of now. We do expect an extremely strong move to happen in the next 2 days, as volatility and trading volume have dropped to multi-month lows again.",2021-06-13 15:47:44+00:00,3102,1351499165

Sentiment remains pretty much in the middle, with uncertainty being at its highest since 2020. There's no clear buying or selling intention and both sides are waiting for the other to make the first move.

Currently holding strong above our $39,460 short term support, tightening it's short term volatility range and printing what looks like an intraday bull-flag. If this bull-flag breaks up in the next 2-8 hours, we expect to reach a high of at least $41,500 with a potential wick extension to $42,000. This level will likely be rejected on our first retest, and our VIP Insiders know what to do😉",2021-06-15 17:05:52+00:00,3121,1351499165

Sentiment building up again as uncertainty has dissipated into short term buying intentions and bullish sentiment. It will officially become mid term bullish once we break above $41,500 with enough volume for continuation. This will likely take us to $52,000 once again.

Not looking good for BTC, dead cat bounced at around $35,000 before reaching resistance at $36,400 and rejecting it with extreme weakness. We're not heading towards $34,000 for a retest where we either bounce back above $38,000 or we dive deep into our $20,000’s",2021-06-19 17:09:32+00:00,3149,1351499165
2123,-1001351499165,"⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment has received one of the strongest hits in months after both diving below the support we all expected to hold ($38,000) and because the $34,000 level we're about to retest has been tested more than once and has a high chance of breaking down.

The confirmation 2 days ago of having CHZ along SHIB and KEEP listed for trading in Coinbase Pro was what caused the explosion in price we expected, making us an instant 25% without any leverage and making CHZ one of the few coins that's still holding it's base level.

That's The Sicilian doing his work🔥🐋

And once again, The Sicilian wasn't wrong. BTC has broken down below its $34,300 mid term support, which is held as resistance, will get us down to a potential low of $30,000 or lower (our next relevant mid term support at $27,000).",2021-06-20 16:06:39+00:00,3154,1351499165

Sentiment has dropped so much in the last 24 hours that there's pretty much only one direction in which it should go (up), however, there's the possibility of the lower retest we told you about, before the strongest upside move we've seen this year.

Yes The Sicilian is one of the best traders in the world, yet he does make mistakes, as every single one of us…

These set of CRV long orders were set 9 days ago expecting a strong reaction from that $1.90 support, which didn’t happen and price broke straight through it. 

We’re closing this positions at a slight 10.9% loss, and we’re publishing it because just as we’re proud of our wins, we’re proud of our losses, which are always lessons and a reminder that the market can always go against us and no trader can consider himself a “pro” if he can’t accept he’ll be wrong once in a while.

Just as The Sicilian told you yesterday, our red button has been completely deactivated until further notice as we expect this to be our definite mid term bottom. The next target for BTC after such a rejection lies at $34,000 and $40,000.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment has exploded on the daily like we've not seen since we broke above $20,000 for the first time since 2017. This is the relief pump and short squeeze we’ve told you about, that will likely reach $50,000 in the next 2 weeks.

BTC has just broken down its short term $33,475 support heading for a $31,500 low above which it's currently sitting. Bulls need a quick and strong move to regain intra-day dominance which has been lost for now. As long as BTC remains above $29,000 however, we're still good for an upside continuation move.",2021-06-25 17:11:42+00:00,3199,1351499165

BTC jumped once again from our $30,000 - $31,000 support before finding its strongest mid term resistance at $33,500 which must be broken before our weekly close if we are to head higher.

Even though sellers have become scarce and buyers are once again entering the game, sentiment remains relatively low, which is pushing away the great majority of buyers. As we said before, a confirmation above $34,000 - $38,000 would push sentiment once again to monthly highs and likely be followed by an even stronger move.

BTC just went down for a short term $33,000 retest where it's still remaining strong in comparison to the rest of the market. We can expect a bounce at around this range which will likely reach our $38,000 - $39,000 higher limit. A break below $32,000 on the other side, will mean a $30,000 retest and probably below.",2021-07-01 17:59:42+00:00,3253,1351499165

Sentiment has decreased in the last 24 hours from our $36,000 highs reaching a multi day low that will likely get us a rubber band effect before our daily close. This will likely get BTC above $34,000 once again.

Currently ranging below our $34,300 key level, BTC is about to define where it will be heading for the next 8-10 weeks. The weekly close in a couple of hours will be the defining factor in this, as closing above $34,300 would signal a long term key level rejection, likely pushing price up to $41,000 once again.",2021-07-11 16:27:37+00:00,3321,1351499165

On the other hand, if we close the week below $34,300 we're likely seeing a brand new wave of bearish sentiment sweeping through the market and pushing price much lower. If this happens and bearish momentum begins to build up, we're more than likely going below $30,000 and to a potential low of $27,000 in no more than a month.

The bears are once again playing games and taking control of our short term price action in the process.

With a $34,300 rejection to the upside and a current short term low of $31,613, the market is not looking very bright, at least for the next few days.

While BTC has dropped only 3% since our daily open, ETH, LTC and other major alts have at least doubled this loss, cutting a more than relevant portion from our total market cap.

We’re currently watching out for a short/mid term confirmation at another $34,300 downside rejection or a $31,118 upside rejection for confirmation before entering a high probability short or long position.

Our total market cap is currently ranging just above $1.340 Trillion after the short term breakdown yesterday.

This is nearly a 50% cut from our $2.5 Trillion All Time High reached in May. Even though we’ve seen corrections of over 90% in the past, we’ve never had such a a steep and high volume reaction before.

This is one of the most important signs we’re likely about to see an equally strong short squeeze reaching a high of $50,000 - $52,000 for BTC and pulling our alts along with it.

Once again retesting our $ lowest mid term support, BTC is about to define if it remains above it and bounces towards new weekly highs or breaks below and takes the entire market down with it.

Probability says up, but bears are not giving out their control that easily.

If we remain above $31,118 we’re heading up, likely to a minimum of $34,000. If we break and close below this level we’re seeing $27,000 in the next 7 days.

Boom. Just as The Sicilian expected we've now bounced perfectly from our invisible $29,400 support where hidden buy walls and orders blocked price from heading lower while panicking sellers sold into large institutional buyers. We can now expect a daily and weekly close continuation up to $34,300",2021-07-21 14:53:36+00:00,3384,1351499165
2349,-1001351499165,"⚪️**SENTIMENT**
From our multi-year lows, sentiment has just picked up for the first time in months, and buyers are gaining short term confidence in the market slowly. Less than 10% of buyers are confident enough to enter the market giving early movers one of the greatest advantages to buy at our current ranges.

BTC currently trading at $32,408 well above our $31,118 key level, showing signs of solid market strength for the weekend. A break above $34,329 is necessary for a mid term bullish confirmation which we expect to have in the next couple of days (before our weekly close).",2021-07-23 15:20:36+00:00,3397,1351499165

Sentiment is increasing at a more than decent rhythm as buyers are gaining more confidence in long positions and entering long positions. Shorts on the other hand are steadily being close, presumably by institutions which is one of the most reliable indicators of a continuation up-move in the next 24-48 hours.

BTC reached A high of $40,581 today, just before dropping to a $36,820 intra-day low due to Amazon speculations.

What’s special about this set of FUD news? That they have no real correlation with the market and specially BTC. This is the short term correction we were talking about and one that has an extremely high probability of being bought back to its highs in the next 24 hours.

Confirmation of this will occur if BTC manages to cross and close above $38,000 again. A bearish continuation is possible (but unlikely) if we once again break below $34,000

Sentiment reaching yearly highs, comparable to the ones in may, while a couple of large sellers are still ""confident"" in a further drop. Once we break above $41,543 we can expect a liquidation spree to push price much higher, at which point we're likely heading up to at least $45,126.

Even though the market remains long term bullish, we do have a higher probability of going for a short term BTC correction in the next 48-72 hours.

This correction will likely break $38,000 and could even touch $34,000 as mid term support. Bears are confident about this move which could dramatically increase the volume of this move.

The lowest we can potentially get (although unlikely for now) is down to $28,000 for a complete liquidity tap. This move would get us the strongest rebound after liquidating even low leverage long positions.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Trading around $39,700 (below its key $41,500 resistance), BTC is likely on the bear's side for now. We've closed green for 10 days in a row (at least on some USD/USDT paired exchanges) and we're up for a short term correction. We expect liquidity below $38,000 (at least and potentially below $34,000 to be tapped before another considerable up-move.",2021-08-02 17:17:07+00:00,3474,1351499165
2437,-1001351499165,"⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment remains extremely high for the bulls (short term), which contributes to the high probability of a correction and sentiment reset. We expect a complete sentiment breakdown if BTC reached $34,000 at which point we would be more than ready to buy.

Bounced with strength from $38,000 BTC is likely reaching $40,500 - $41,500 before continuing its potential correction down to our expected $34,000 support level.

Sentiment has increased intra-day as FOMO buyers are quickly entering short term and high leverage long positions. This is another reason why we expect this move up to stop before our previous $42,500 highs. A break above this level, however, would mean an invalidation of our mid term correction and a potential run up to $45,000.

Sentiment is currently breaking multi-month highs with levels not seen since our May All Time Highs.

Currently trading around $43,800 BTC bulls are demonstrating strength not seen since May.

Due to our short term sentiment drop (along short term price action), we could potentially see a $42,000 - $42,600 retest in the next 24-48 hours before any higher continuation and leg up. This will provide enough liquidity to head up stronger than we currently are.

He called it “a blatant power grab that will hurt American innovation,” adding, “We don’t need another backroom deal between Gensler and Elizabeth Warren.”

And much more than a power grad, it’s simply a ridiculous over-reach. It’s something that no matter how hard any government tries, it wont succeed.

The Sicilian knows exactly what to expect, and after our latest short term correction, BTC could be going for a bit of a deeper dive before a reversal and upwards continuation. The main levels we're currently watching for this reaction are $43,707 and $40,944. In case we shoot up straight from our current ranges, we’ll consider it extremely bullish and reassess our new key levels.",2021-08-16 16:35:19+00:00,3570,1351499165

Currently trading barely above $46,000 BTC is showing short term signs of weakness and an intra-day bearish advantage which could push price down to our $43,707 key support in the next few days before a strong buy-back and pump. On the other hand, we could break up straight from here, which would be ridiculously bullish.",2021-08-17 18:03:20+00:00,3576,1351499165

Such move (break above $50,000) would easily take us much higher, probably touching $54,000 - $55,000 in just a couple of days after breaking up. With this scenario, sentiment would absolutely explode and would easily reach new highs not seen since May.

Looks like we just got a short term dead cat bounce meant to liquidate high leverage short positions before heading lower into our main resistance and the level from which we do expect a strong bullish reaction. $43,707 will likely be retested in the next 24 hours, just before kicking out the last couple of panic sellers that remain around and heading back up.",2021-08-18 16:33:21+00:00,3582,1351499165

Sentiment has seen a short term push in the last couple of hours as price action for all major pairs has flipped in favor of the bulls. If we don't manage to break at least above $46,000 in the next few hours, we're likely going to our $43,707 support once and for all (which would be the highest probability and best scenario for now)

**Salvadoran Finance Minister States Bitcoin Use Will Be Optional**

Alejandro Zelaya, the Salvadoran Finance Minister, stated that the use of Bitcoin will be fully optional in El Salvador in a televised interview yesterday. However, this caused confusion because it seems to contradict article seven of the Bitcoin Law that was approved last June, where it is explained that every economic agent will have to accept bitcoin as a form of payment.

Not exactly the news we expected to hear (and likely the cause of our earlier short term drop), however, we still expect a steady adoption of cryptocurrencies into the world’s economy. This will take some time, but it’ll be worth every second.

**Free Bitcoin: Mayor of This US City Raising Funds to Give All Residents $1,000 in BTC**

**The mayor of Cool Valley, a city in the U.S. state of Missouri, is raising funds in order to give bitcoin to all residents in his city. However, he does not want them to sell their bitcoin immediately, noting that when the price of the cryptocurrency is $500,000 per coin years later, people are “going to really regret” selling.

Sentiment has peaked yesterday after reaching $49,834 and retracing back down just over $1,000. If price action is held above $48,000 we would be heading above $50,000 in no more than a couple of hours probably before our weekly close, which would push sentiment even higher.

Just as The Sicilian told you almost a month ago after reaching $28,000, we just touched, retested and broke $50,000 to the upside.

Sentiment is what will play the biggest role in our next move, as we need a very strong sentiment push for the bulls in orders to eat away the sell walls we currently have around $50,500. Once this happens, our next strongest resistance lies at $58,000 followed by our former All Time High.

We're now ranging just above $48,000 and not looking the best, at least until our daily close.

Depending on how Sentiment reacts to our current range and to a potential $50,000 retest, we'll be defining our next mid term move. As you already know, if we break and close above $50,500 on the 4 hour or daily chart, we're almost certainly heading much higher into $50,000's territory potentially reaching a high over $48,000.

BTC looks like it's trying the hardest it can to hold above $47,000 and break above $50,000 with decisive volume. The $1,500+ spike we've just seen is signaling a possible short term bullish reversal from our current levels. This move will, however, need to break and close above $50,468 to be confirmed, in which case we would be exploding to at least $54,000 in a matter of a week or less.",2021-08-25 17:39:36+00:00,3635,1351499165

**The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency network, in terms of market capitalization, Ethereum, saw a chain split today as a software bug affected a large quantity of full node clients. In mid-August, developers discovered a vulnerability and distributed an update called “Hades Gamma” to resolve the problem. However, a large number of full node clients did not leverage the patch and the network forked.

**➖➖➖➖➖
Why is ETH so relevant with our current market conditions? Because ETH is the middleman between BTC and all other alts in this market.

While BTC is generally the first asset to move in any direction, ETH determines if all other coins will move in the same direction as BTC, in the opposite direction, or will remain still with a pre-move that is generally overlooked by most traders.

We’ve mastered the art of catching this pre-move before it affects alts, which gives us an edge pretty much nobody else has in the market.

We’re closely looking at this, specially now, as we’re expecting more than a “decent move” in the next couple of days, and you guessed it… we’ll be the first ones to ride it😉

Looking like BTC could be going for a short term dive, price action is having a very hard time holding above $48,500. This is currently our most important key level to confirm another move up, which will only occur if enough buyer show up and hold price above this level.

If this doesn’t happen, BTC is likely heading down to $47,000 where we could see the bounce we’re expecting.

Sentiment remains high, however, it has remained static since the latest short term drop to $49,700. This is a bad sign for the bulls, who are still expecting a leg up in the next few days.

Sentiment has stabilized as the week is just starting and could see a jump in the next few days if we see our bullish momentum increase as expected. If BTC drops to a $50,468 retest, which is currently very likely, we would see a sentiment drop and panic sellers all around, giving us the chance we're looking for to add to our spot long positions.

Sentiment has once again floored after such an upside rejection, and will likely remain down while we don't break above $48,000 with enough volume to confirm this is actually a mid term bottom. It our current $44,000 breaks on the 4H, sentiment will quickly turn negative, potentially pulling us much lower.

This is one of the most important bullish signs we were looking for before a continuation and now that we've got it, we're likely heading higher in the next 48 hours.

Sentiment is once again in favor of the bulls, as new buyers are entering the market after our previously mentioned confirmation. Sentiment, however, still has space to move up, meaning BTC should be able to have that $50,000 - $51,000 leg up from here.

On the other hand, if the beginning of our next mid term market cycle (from September 20th all the way to the last week of October) is marked by bearish price action and eventually forms a bearish mid term market structure, we’ll see a free fall in sentiment which would take us once again below $44,000 for a retest before any further move.

**Getting closer and closer to the last official weekend trading session of the month with a relatively strong price action, which likely means Saturday and Sunday volatility will play in favor of the bulls. Our strongest resistance for now lies at $45,200 and our strongest support just below our current price action at $43,330.",2021-09-23 16:58:48+00:00,3844,1351499165

A short term sentiment push could easily take price up to $45,200 and above, which would confirm a a much stronger move potentially up to $50,500 again. This will only occur if buying pressure and bullish momentum manage to build up in the next 2 days, shaking out short positions and grabbing upside liquidity.

Sentiment has seen a slight drop in the last 24 hours, but mostly due to our weekend trading hours, which are giving us a higher chance of volatility spikes and chop.

We already told our VIP Insiders a couple of times about this, and it’s now nothing you weren’t prepared for.

The market is overall looking weak and considering that BTC Market Dominance has reached long term historical support (all time lows), $ETH will likely suffer a bit in the next couple of weeks.

If the daily closes below $2,864 we’ll be heading down to our next key support level at $2,590 which is likely not holding strongly, and would take us straight to $2,200 from where we do expect a very strong reaction.

If the bulls manage to gain strength from our current level (which has a low probability of happening), and close above $3,150 on the daily, we could see this move down as a fake-down and eventually head much higher.

**Currently trading just around $43,000 BTC has pushed itself above what we can consider a “safe zone” after rejecting further downside from $41,000. In order to continue up, however, the bulls will have to be stronger and push BTC above $43,330 with at least a 4H close and ideally a daily close. This would push BTC higher into our higher $40,000's territory and potentially above $50,000 for the first time in weeks.",2021-09-30 16:02:26+00:00,3896,1351499165

Bitcoin’s hashrate has been climbing steadily over the last three months and rose more than 40% after the network’s hashpower was below 90 exahash per second (EH/s) on July 5. The trend has led to a consecutive run of five bitcoin mining difficulty accruals with another increase expected during the next transition.

This, is one of the strongest bullish indicators of the year, as it will drastically reduce the selling supply from miners at lower prices.

Sentiment, as we expected, dropped to weekly lows after the $1,500 move down from our $57,875 local high, showing how weak retail players actually are. This indicates we could potentially have a deeper correction before heading up again, a move that would clear our emotional players and make space for smart money to enter the market.

If this levels remains respected for the next couple of 4H closes, we can easily expect a break above $65,000 which being our current All Time High, you take us even higher into $70,000 - $72,000 territory. This, however, depends on overall market sentiment and how strong bullish momentum will remain.

$1.75 Trillion for Climate Change, Social Services — Biden’s 'Build Back Better' Plan Advances While Inflation Grips US**

The US Dollar is about to go on one of the deepest corrections we’ve ever seen, and sending crypto flying out of the stratosphere in the meantime…

This week, U.S. lawmakers are preparing to debate the advance of Joe Biden’s Build Back Better proposal, which is now estimated at $1.75 trillion. The new proposal follows the expansive monetary policy the Federal Reserve engaged in during the last two years expanding the money supply like never before. Meanwhile, U.S. inflation is at a 30 year high and the central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) plans to assess new strategies today.

**BTC currently trading just above $60,000 after its latest shots term correction. If the bears keep pushing down with selling action, we could see a deeper correction down to our mid $50,000’s. For now, however, we’re still closer to a new break of our All Time Highs

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment has dropped sharply after the drop to $61,000 and even though this gets us a short term bearish outlook on the market in general, it’s also extremely positive for the bulls, who have reset their sentiment rating and could be ready for a stronger push up (mid term).

Sentiment has exploded along price action, reaching highs not seen since 2017. We can expect this also to increase if BTC decides to head even higher, which would make a sentiment drop extremely difficult at least in a couple of weeks until we reach December 2017 hype levels.

Sentiment has dropped even lower after the $60,000 rejection we already mentioned, and it still has space to dive a bit if bears remain as strong as they currently are. In the short term, the only chance for bulls is a very strong and high volume move up caused by news.

**Mid-week and BTC is currently trading around our same weekly average of $57,000. We are currently under the short term control of the bears, which could push prices a bit lower before a potential bullish reaction and reversal. $54,340 is our strongest support for now, which if held, is likely taking us back to our All Time Highs.",2021-11-24 12:42:40+00:00,4262,1351499165
3217,-1001351499165,"⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment is currently extremely low and hasn't moved much over the last 48 hours. If we happen to see further negative news and sentiment across the market, BTC could potentially break below the $54,340 support we mentioned. In this case, we would be confirming a mid term bearish trend towards $50,000 or lower.

**BTC has been showing short term signs of weakness after retesting its $57,840 and being rejected with a decent short term bearish strength.

If we see price action dive any lower in the next 24 hours, we'll be seeing a dramatic decrease in market sentiment, which will likely send BTC down to $54,340 for another mid term retest before confirming its next move.

Sentiment is currently dropping very quickly after seeing price action being unable to break above $58,000 with decisive volume. This could play an important role in what we'll be seeing over the next 2-3 days. If sentiment sees a deeper drop, we could be setting up another leg down before a bounce.

**BTC has remained pretty silent over the past 48 hours, trading around our $50,468 key level without any important high volume break above or below it.

Sentiment has stabilized over the past few days, becoming slightly positive after our drop down to $41,000. We're currently trading in a key range where a slight increase in market sentiment will likely cause a chain reaction and will give us the mid term move confirmation we're expecting.

Sentiment remains slightly negative in the market overall, however this remains a positive sign for move up, since it means that most of the short positions that we're going to be opened, are already active, and a slight bullish push up could quickly build up momentum and reach new mid term highs.

**Turkish Lira Slump Contributes to Rise in Turkey's Daily Crypto Trades to Over One Million**

Just another example of how global economies getting hit only give people more reasons to believe in Bitcoin and Crypto.

The popularity of cryptocurrencies in economically embattled Turkey has continued to surge with the number of daily trades now surpassing one million, a report has said. This surge in trades has been attributed to the depreciating lira which plunged to a new low against the USD on December 20.

Short term sentiment has dropped steeply over the last 48 hours, along price action. This means that buyers are once again fearful and backing off on lower time frames. We could go for a short term retest of $34,000 - $35,000 before bouncing once again, however this will depend on how price action develops.

During the course of the early morning trading sessions on Thursday (EST), 24-hour statistics show the crypto economy dropped more than 11% in value against the U.S. dollar. While the leading crypto asset bitcoin shed close to 10%, a myriad of alternative digital assets lost close to 20% in value. The crypto market downturn is being blamed on Russia invading Ukraine’s borders as Russian president Vladimir Putin’s troops entered the country before dawn on February 24. The digital currency community has been discussing the situation and many crypto advocates have different opinions about the current geopolitical risk and its future effects on the crypto economy.

This is an important factor in what to expect from the market over the next few weeks, and depending on which type of momentum starts building up, we'll see our mid term move.

**Bulls were played yesterday by BTC after reaching a $40,031 high and quickly dumping towards $35,500 (level around which we're still trading). If price action remains this low, we could see one more leg down towards $34,329 before a potential mid term bounce, which would once again retest $41,500.",2022-05-06 09:51:01+00:00,5221,1351499165

Short term sentiment has gone from extremely bullish to imploding in less than 24 hours with our last drop. This means that buyers are once again fearful of even short term positions and this could lead to the leg down we've mentioned.

**Looking at our current short term BTC price action, we can clear see remnants of the bullish momentum we’ve built for the last couple of days and a potential mid term continuation towards higher levels if we manage to hold the market strength we’ve built up. $36,000 is currently our strongest resistance level.",2022-06-01 11:56:01+00:00,5364,1351499165

**BTC has once again headed down towards our $29,331 mid term support level, from where we can see a decent buy-back reaction on lower time frames, however, this level must be held on the next couple of 4H closes in order for the bulls to have the chance to regain strength and once again move above $31,000",2022-06-10 16:12:01+00:00,5417,1351499165

Sentiment has turned slightly negative, mostly due to short term bearish price action, however, lower trading volume than expected is playing a major role in our current move, and could mean that sellers are actually not gaining strength and the bulls are about to step in, for which we still need confirmation.

**BTC has broken below $20,000 reaching a low of almost $18,000 from where we still haven't seen any indication of buying action entering the market, meaning that we still have a high probability of heading straight towards $17,800 for a long term support retest before a strong bounce, which we're also ready to catch.",2022-06-18 18:01:01+00:00,5464,1351499165

Market sentiment is currently at the lowest point we've seen since 2018, when BTC broke down towards $3,000 and this is generally a point in which we can expect to see a strong bounce and come-back reaction in price action. A gradual increase in lower time frame sentiment could mark the bottom for this move.

If this trend-line is to be respected over the next 1-2 weeks, we should see a $19,000 - $19,500 retest before a much stronger move up, which would be confirmed with a break and close above $22,000 and could potentially take us towards $26,000.",2022-07-07 16:22:01+00:00,5559,1351499165

Sentiment over the last 24 hours remains pretty much the same, considering that we haven't seen any important move in terms of price action for either BTC, ETH or alts. Sentiment for the next couple of weeks will depend on how well the bulls can hold above $19,000, which could get us another rally in mid term bullish sentiment.

Sentiment has increased slightly over the last 24 hours, with both BTC and ETH seeing very decent short term moves and alts starting to show signs of mid and long term support. If sentiment increases further over the next 2 weeks along price action and overall positive market structure, we're likely confirming this as our macro bottom and heading for a id term rally on BTC and alts.

**Bitcoin's Inverse Correlation With Inflation-Adjusted Bond Yield Hits Record High**

Bitcoin's fortunes are more closely tied to the U.S. real or inflation-adjusted bond yield than ever, with the two increasingly moving in opposite directions.

At press time, the 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the yield on the 10-year U.S. inflation-indexed security stood just shy of the record -0.95 reached at the end of June.

The record inverse or negative correlation means bitcoin is moving in the opposite direction of the inflation-adjusted yield. A correlation coefficient is a number between +1 and -1, representing the linear interdependence of two variables or sets of data. If the correlation coefficient is -1, it means relationship between the two variables is negative 100% of the time. If the number is at +1, the two securities move in the same direction.

In roughly 65 days, there’s a chance Ethereum’s highly anticipated transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), otherwise known as The Merge, could be implemented. The information was shared via “a planning timeline” on Twitter, which noted the shift from PoW to PoS could happen on September 19. The source stemmed from Ethereum Beacon chain community director, Superphiz, who further stressed that The Merge “timeline isn’t final,” and that people should “look out for official announcements.”

Sentiment has seen a short term drop mostly due to BTC and ETH, which have led the local correction after our weekly close. The bulls still have a chance of regaining this momentum over the next couple of days, in which case we would need to see a solid move above $23,000 and a daily close above $24,000 for confirmation.

Short term sentiment has increased over the last 24 hours, and it's showing potential to reach higher if it maintains its current strength. If bearish sentiment kicks in on lower time frames though, and spreads to higher time frames, we can very likely see a move towards $21,000 before another bounce.

**US Regulator 'Improperly' Pushing Banks to Avoid Serving Crypto Companies, Lawmaker Says**

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) may be leaning on banks to prevent them from providing services to cryptocurrency companies, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said Tuesday, citing communications he had received.

In a letter directed to Acting FDIC Director Martin Gruenberg, Toomey wrote that he had heard from ""affected parties"" and whistleblower communications that claimed the federal bank regulator had tried to ""deter banks from doing business with lawful cryptocurrency-related companies,"" even though providing services to these companies is not illegal. Toomey asked the regulator to confirm whether any FDIC official had indeed asked banks to not do business with crypto firms, and if so, to explain why.

FTX rode the crypto craze to a billion dollars in revenue last year while expanding its global footprint through a flurry of acquisitions

The audited financials give a rare glimpse into the privately held company’s finances. FTX was profitable, quickly expanding across the globe and saw breakneck growth.

The crypto exchange’s revenue soared more than 1,000% from $89 million to $1.02 billion in 2021. Its profitability, like many start-ups, depends on how you measure it. Operating income was $272 million, up from $14 million a year earlier. FTX saw net income of $388 million last year, up from just $17 million a year earlier.

Short term sentiment has increased slightly due to support above $20,000, however, the bears still have a chance of pushing prices lower with an increase in mid term selling volume.

**Top crypto company defies U.S. sanctions on service that hid stolen assets**

The U.S. government’s latest effort to crack down on the illicit use of cryptocurrency by rogue foreign regimes and criminals is running into resistance from the industry itself, including one of its largest and most influential players.

Earlier this month, the Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency service it alleges has allowed North Korean hackers and others to launder billions of dollars’ worth of digital assets stolen in virtual heists. Typically, sanctions target individuals, countries or companies, and U.S. firms comply by ensuring they avoid doing business with them.

**Crypto’s massive marketing efforts have drawn few new investors**

Over the past year, crypto companies like FTX, Coinbase and Crypto have shelled out tens of millions of dollars to attract new customers. “Fortune favors the brave,” Matt Damon famously said in a Crypto TV Spot as he tried to induce Americans to open their digital wallets.

Now a core metric of how successful they were has been returned, and experts say it’s an eye-opening one: not successful at all. The number of people who invested in crypto has not expanded since last September before the push began, according to a new study led by Pew Research Center.

Short and mid term sentiment have become pretty much neutral over the last 2 days, considering that after our move down to $20,000, we've seen a complete evaporation of volume for both sides. The market seems to be extremely silent awaiting a high volume move, for which we're getting ready Bullets.

If price remains below this level after our daily close, we’re very likely heading lower for a retest before a potential mid term bounce.

Sentiment has increased a bit on lower time frames, after seeing some short term support around $19,000, which if manages to hold on until our next couple of 4 Hour closes, could get us a higher move if not a complete mid term buyback towards our previous local highs. Mid term sentiment does need a stronger confirmation.

BTC has exploded just as the Sicilian told you over the last couple of days.

Short and mid term sentiment have also exploded for BTC, ETH and most alts, which have headed up between 5% and 15% over the last 24 hours, with potential to head even higher if enough bullish momentum is built. Long term sentiment remains relatively neutral, and will need a long term BTC break above $26,000 - $28,000 to become fully bullish.

Bitcoin’s hashrate has been running hot despite the lower prices and the recent difficulty increases. In fact, blocks are being discovered faster than the ten-minute block interval average and because of this factor, the network’s reward halving may come sooner than expected. While some halving counters that simply leverage the ten-minute average note the halving is expected in May or April 2024, halving counters leveraging precise block interval times show the halving event could happen as early as March 1, 2024.

Ethereum has officially transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) network to a proof-of-stake (PoS) system after seven years of operating as a PoW blockchain. The Merge has forced ethereum miners to transition to other PoW-based tokens and after the ruleset change was codified, a handful of PoW coins compatible with the Ethash algorithm saw their hashrates skyrocket. Ethereum Classic’s hashrate has tripled in size since The Merge was triggered by Ethereum’s Paris Upgrade.

BTC is currently trading below our $19,225 key mid term support/resistance level, which could determine BC""s price action for the next couple of days if we see an increase in volume around our weekly close in just a couple of hours.

Short term sentiment remains relatively low while mid and long term overall market sentiment remain neutral, expecting our next high volume mid term move. The market is getting tighter and tighter every hour, which will likely lead to our next mid term move in the next few days, which will be followed by mid term sentiment.

**Fed Chair Jerome Powell Says a 'Difficult Correction' Should Balance US Housing Market**

Following the Covid-19 pandemic, real estate investors did extremely well, despite the millions of Americans that were put out of work and faced evictions during the lockdowns in 2020. Stimulus put a bandage on the financial wounds inflicted by Mainstreet business shutdowns and deadlocked supply chains. In fact, after the pandemic, America’s housing market boomed to new heights and soared amid rising inflation. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell hinted this week that the U.S. housing market needs a correction, and he believes it can be adjusted in a way so “people can afford houses again.”

After showing decent bullish strength for the last couple of days, BTC has once again seen a short term drop towards $19,500, where we remain with lower than expected volume, which makes it much harder for a mid term confirmation to occur. $19,000 remains our strongest mid term support and $21,000 remains our most important key resistance level, which could determine our next big move.",2022-10-07 16:59:01+00:00,6037,1351499165

Sentiment in the short term has decreased to new daily lows after our latest move down, however mid and long term sentiment remains neutral, which means that we haven't seen any confirmation for either the bulls or the bulls yet. We're likely seeing a bigger move around our weekly close, with which we also expect sentiment to start its next mid term move.

$19,225 remains our most important mid term level for BTC, which is holding up as resistance for now, however a solid 4H break and close above this level would likely accelerate bullish momentum and take BTC once again above $20,000 which would likely push ETH and other high market cap alts to new short or mid term highs.",2022-10-16 10:17:03+00:00,6086,1351499165

Sentiment on lower and higher time frames has once again become neutral, showing no significant signs of a breakdown or breakout in the short or mid term. We can still expect to see some market uncertainty before a clear price action and sentiment confirmation, however, it will more than likely happen in the next 1-2 weeks, and we’re ready.

After almost 2 weeks of pretty much no important high volume move, BTC has finally shown enough short term strength and bullish volume to break and close above $21,000 on the daily. This move has a high probability of seeing a short/mid term continuation in the next couple of weeks, which would be sending BTC and a couple of high market cap alts towards new range highs.",2022-10-26 09:13:01+00:00,6135,1351499165

Short term sentiment has exploded to new mid term highs alongside daily trading volume, which has more than doubled over the next 24 hours. Mid and long term sentiment remain neutral, however, the bulls are showing a high probability of sentiment mid term sentiment towards new highs, which could also start kicking off long term bullish sentiment in the next 1-2 months.

Short term sentiment has become neutral over the last 2 days, while mid term sentiment remains bearish with the increase in bearish volume for BTC, ETH and higher market cap alts we saw since the FTX collapse. Depending on what we see over the next few days, we'll determine new mid and long term sentiment for the rest of the market.

Short and mid term sentiment for BTC, ETH and most higher market cap alts has decreased drastically over the last 24 hours, considering that buyers are nowhere to be seen.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC has once again seen an increase in selling pressure, taking us to a $16,000 retest and a potential weekly breakdown that could take us to new long term lows before turning into a mid term move up. Long term support for BTC remains at $15,700 meaning that as long as we hold above this level on higher time frames, we should have nothing to worry about in terms of a much lower breakdown.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short and mid term sentiment are once again considerably bearish, with new buyers being extremely fearful of taking positions and sellers increasing their sizes significantly. Long term sentiment is still slowing down, which could be indicating that a long term bottom is near for BTC and the market in general. We still need to see price action and market structure in the mid term to determine this.

**Bitcoin Bullets® Market Analysis**
November 22, 2022
➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Bears have once again gained the lower time frame edge in the market, pushing BTC down to $15,500 and increasing the overall seller pressure for most alts including ETH, which has followed BTC's price action for the last few weeks. We're likely going to see an increase in overall trading volume and volatility over the next few weeks, and the direction the market takes for the next months will depend on it.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
As we've already told you, short and mid term sentiment are on the floor, seeing long term lows not seen since our last macro bottom. Long term sentiment has been showing no signs of an increase to the upside or to the downside yet, however, we can expect this to happen in the next couple of months, with our next clear break and close above or below our current mid term range.

**Bitcoin Bullets® Market Analysis**
November 23, 2022
➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC has seen a very decent and significant short term bounce over the last 24 hours, after retesting $15,500 with volume and once again reaching $16,500, which has also pushed the rest of the market on lower time frames. We can see some alts gaining enough momentum and strength for a mid term reversal upon confirmation, and we could be about to get one of the strongest moves of the year.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has become bullish after our latest move, which has mainly affected higher market cap alts, sending them to new mid term highs and showing potential for an even higher move. Mid term sentiment remains relatively neutral but has a high chance of becoming bullish with a breakout move, and long term sentient is waiting for a solid mid term market confirmation.

➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC is currently trading around $16,500 with very decent short term strength. If the bulls manage to see a break and close on the daily above $18,500, we'd be confirming a break above our mid term range and a very likely mid term continuation towards even higher levels. This would also pull ETH and top alts towards new mid and potentially long term highs.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has now become bullish and could be gaining even more strength in the next couple of days, depending on price action. Mid and long term sentiment are currently mostly neutral, and looking like they could range around the same levels for the next couple of weeks or until BTC sees a decisive mid/long term move to the upside or to the downside, which would determine our next long term market move.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
After that last key mid term support retest around $15,600, BTC has remained stable above $16,000 for the last couple of days, showing signs of short and mid term strength that could send us to new mid term highs in the next couple of weeks. For mid term confirmation, though, we still need a solid break and close above $18,500 which is the most important mid term resistance level we're looking for.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short and mid term sentiment is currently extremely neutral and waiting for a high volume confirmation before gaining momentum in favor of the bulls or the bears. Long term sentiment is a whole different story, and even though it's currently highly neutral, it will need a much stronger break and close either above or below our mid term range before titling in favor of any side.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
We can clearly see how BTC has seen absolutely no volatility over the last 5 days, with one of the tightest ranges we've seen in months, and neither the bulls nor the bears are showing signs of a gain in momentum enough to break either above or below it decisively. For now, the bulls are waiting for a mid term break and close above $18,500 while the bears are looking for a break and close below $15,500, for another mid term move.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short and mid term sentiment have become absolutely neutral over the past weeks, showing no signs of either a break above or below our current range. Once we see the mid term confirmation we've been talking about, we'll see the increase in either bullish or bearish sentiment that we're expecting. This will define price action leading to our yearly close.

The market remains neutral, and BTC is still trading in the weekly range we've been in for the past week, with no important price action below or above it for now. We can see some support around $16,000, however this level could be broken in the next couple of days by the bears, which would take us straight to new long term lows before a potential bounce. 

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
For short and mid term sentiment to become bullish, buyers need to get a solid daily break and close above $18,500 with which we would regain one of our most important levels, and likely see a further increase in bullish momentum and volume. Bearish sentiment would be gained with a break and close $16,000, which is currently less likely but still possible.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Overall, the market is currently showing no clear short or mid term direction for BTC or higher market cap alts including ETH. For BTC, our $15,500 - $17,500 range remains solid and in place which will need to be broken either above or below for it to confirm our next mid term move a break above, and we're going towards $20,000+ while a break below would likely take us towards $14,000 or lower.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment remains pretty much neutral on most time frames, however, short term bulls have been gaining some strength over the last few days, which can be seen in our latest BTC move from sub $16,000 levels up to $16,500 where we're trading now with decent strength. What we can expect for a new explosion in market sentiment is a solid 10% move up or down.

Starting a new monthly trading session and the bulls have managed to push BTC once again above $16,000 with decent volume and strength, however, it hasn't been enough for a definite breakout move just yet.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC looks like it's about to print its third higher low on the 4H, and if the bulls manage to gain enough strength on lower time frames after this triple bottom confirmation, we can expect to see a solid break and close above $19,000. If this is confirmed, we'd be likely heading up to $22,000 or even higher in the next month. The yearly close will be extremely heavy in terms of long term market structure, for which we're waiting.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short and long term sentiment remains neutral while mid term sentiment is still holding a decent amount of the bullish momentum gained over the last week. This mid term sentiment would only continue on its way up if the bulls manage to push price action once again above $18,000 as we've already mentioned.

For now, the market is simply ranging between $18,500 and $15,000 (levels that will determine our next big move, and price action for the next months).

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment on lower time frames i currently neutral, considering that we haven't seen any kind of important price action change over the last couple of days. Mid term sentiment, however, remains slightly bullish considering that the bears have been unable to push price below $15,500 despite having 4 solid attempts with volume.

**While the FTX Co-Founder Claims He 'Wasn’t Running Alameda,' SBF Is Asked Why He Threw Caroline Ellison 'Under the Bus'**

While the former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) has done numerous interviews, during these discussions he’s explained on numerous occasions that as far as Alameda Research is concerned, he “wasn’t running Alameda.” SBF wasn’t the CEO of the trading firm Alameda Research as the job was handled by Caroline Ellison, a former Jane Street trader and Stanford graduate. Ellison has been super silent since FTX’s collapse and there’s been speculation that she fled Hong Kong to reside in Dubai.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
The market is currently ranging meaning on lower time frames, meaning that neither the bulls nor the bears carry a significant advantage. This is expected to change in the next 1-2 weeks, when we're likely having a solid higher volume breakout move which would be pushing the entire market towards new mid and potentially long term highs.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment hasn't changed much over the last few days, showing neutrality on pretty much all time frames, and expecting to remain the same until our weekly close, when we could see a an increase in trading volume, volatility and finally a solid confirmation move to the upside or to the downside.

During the last seven days, bitcoin’s price has remained above the $16K region following the aftermath of FTX’s collapse.

BTC is still ranging between $15,700 and $18,600, which are currently our most important mid term interest levels, which are going to determine our next high volume move to the upside or to the downside. This will happen in no more than a couple of weeks, and once it gains momentum, it will last for months.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment is currently slightly bullish, after seeing a pretty solid lower time frame move above $17,000. Mid and long term sentiment remains neutral, and waiting for our next breakout or breakdown move. Once sentiment gains strength towards either side it will be extremely hard to stop, potentially marking the beginning of our next macro move.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
$16,800 is currently showing very decent short and mid term strength as support for BTC, which is held on higher time frames, could very much send  price action towards new mid term highs. For confirmation, we still need that solid daily break above $18,500, after which the bulls would have more than enough strength to head towards $22,000 - $23,000.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Mid and long term sentiment has both turned neutral over the last weeks, considering that BTC has shown absolutely no intention of breaking above or below our current trading range (at least for now). Short term sentiment has seen a small decrease over the past few hours, since BTC has seen a small drop after an attempted breakout.

No change visible yet for BTC in terms of price action, market structure or overall mid/long term trading stats. We can see that the volume remains extremely low on pretty much all time frames, and that our $15,500 - $18,500 trading range remains BTC's cage, at least until solid breakout/breakdown move to kick off our next significant direction.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has decreased slightly over the last 24 hours, however, mid and long term sentiment remain neutral and waiting for the start of our next big move to grab a side. Once sentiment picks off, it will likely gain strength quickly towards new mid and potentially long term highs or lows, depending if the bulls or the bears make the move theirs.

Even though we haven't seen any relevant lower time frame move over the last few days for BTC, we can clearly see that the bulls have formed a very decent intra-day support level around $16,700, which if held over the next couple of days, could get us a solid bounce towards new mid term highs above $17,500. If this level doesn’t hold, we're retesting $16,000.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has increased slightly over the last 24 hours, however, mid and long term sentiment remain stable and neutral.

There has been pretty much no change in BTC's price action or market structure over the last 2 weeks, showing the same $1,000 trading range with no break and close above or below it. This, combined with a decreasing daily overall trading volume, is showing one of the higher probabilities we've had this year of an ultra high volume explosive move in the next few weeks, for which we're ready.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has once again seen a very steep lower time frame drop, considering our current overall price action and the fact that daily trading volume has reached a new multi-month low of $23 Billion, which could be the catalyst factor for our next move, depending which side of the market starts gaining mid term volume and momentum first. Mid and long term sentiment remain neutral, and waiting for our next big move.

**Talks of Issuing a New FTT Token Fuel Coin’s Price Despite FTT's Broken Tokenomics Scheme**

Roughly 29 days ago FTX filed for bankruptcy, and the crypto ecosystem has been dealing with a rollercoaster ride of market fluctuations and community drama ever since then. Moreover, the now-bankrupt crypto trading platform’s exchange token FTT is still trading above $1 per unit, and it managed to climb 23.4% higher against the U.S. dollar during the past seven days.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC has once again remained in our short term trading range for the last 24 hours, still showing absolutely no price action changes above $17,500 or below $16,500, which will be necessary to kick off our next high volume bullish or bearish move. Alts are currently bleeding slightly, and waiting for BTC and ETH to take a side before once again gaining either upside or downside momentum.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Currently short term sentiment along the whole market has decreased slightly, showing a couple of large and mid sized alts some bearish price action. Mid and log term sentiment for the entire market, however, remains neutral and showing no signs of a higher volume breakout or breakdown move. We'll be updating on this as price action progresses.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Just as The Sicilian told you all, BTC has finally gained short term upside strength and volume, reaching a local high of $18,000 and has pushed most of our Sicilian picks up to new short term highs along with it. We still haven't broken above our $18,500 key resistance level, which must see a clean break for mid term confirmation, but we have a much higher probability in favor of the bulls at this time.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has once again exploded in favor of the bulls, reaching new monthly highs, however, mid and long term sentiment remain stable and relatively neutral, at least until we see a much higher volume break and close above $18,500, where we would see an absolute mid term sentiment breakout. As for long term sentiment, we're going to need sustained momentum for a couple of weeks/months.

Binance US operates as an independent entity in the United States but still bears the same name and logo as the global Binance crypto exchange. As the name implies, Binance US caters primarily to American crypto traders.

According to Binance US president and CEO Brian Shroder, eliminating fees on both BTC and ETH cements the company's position “as the low fee leader in crypto.” He added that “now, more than ever, it is critical that platforms operate with users’ interests first.”

BTC has managed to hold the short term strength and momentum it gained yesterday with that move towards $18,000. We’re currently trading well above $17,400 (which had been our most important short term key resistance level for over a week) and we're looking at a potential move towards new mid term highs in the next few months if this momentum is held.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment has increased to new monthly highs after yesterday's move, however, most of the market remains skeptic about our next mid/long term move, for which we still need confirmation. If we manage to see a solid daily break and close above $18,500, we're going to see a rapid and violent increase in mid term sentiment.

On Tuesday, the former CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), appeared in court with his newly appointed lawyer Mark Cohen, and his legal team asked the Bahamian judge Joyann Ferguson-Pratt to release SBF on bail with an ankle bracelet. Amid the lengthy court hearing reports detail that SBF’s parents Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried attended the proceedings. Toward the end of the hearing, judge Ferguson-Pratt denied SBF’s request to be released on bail and remanded Bankman-Fried to the Bahamian jail until Feb. 8, 2023.

With a solid high volume move from $15,500 up to $18,350 in 20 days, BTC has demonstrated decent bullish price action and a potential for a much higher continuation in the next couple of weeks.

Short term sentiment has seen a pretty high volume drop after retesting $17,500 and could head a bit lower in the next couple of days before a bullish continuation for BTC and alts.

Currently trading just around $17,000 after seeing a short term drop from $18,400 over the last couple of days. This drop has also pushed the rest of the market down with decent volume, and is currently showing the potential for lower move in the next couple of days if bearish momentum builds up. A break and close above $18,500 will confirm another leg up.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has once again imploded with recent price action, reaching new weekly lows and looking for a deeper dive in the next couple of days if our current momentum continues to build up. Considering our mid term price action range, however, we can see mid and long term sentiment remaining stable and neutral, at least until a bigger and higher volume move up or down from here.

The bears have once again gained dominance and traction on lower time frames, with yet another local low at $16,600 and showing no signs of a short or mid term bounce for now. This means BTC could potentially head as low as $15,500 in the next days before a strong higher volume continuation. With a break and close below $15,500, however, we'd be looking at a potential move towards $12,000. 

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has once again seen a lower drop over the last 24 hours, and has started to drag mid term sentiment down along with it, which can be clearly seen with altcoin price action (including ETH). Mid and long term sentiment could still be saved by the bulls, however, for this we need a solid BTC break and close above $18,500 int he next few weeks.

Short term market structure for BTC has once again become relatively stable, after finding decent support around $16,500.

Alts are expected to follow either way, including ETH.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short tern and intra-day market sentiment remains bearish, considering the violent 9.5% move we've seen from our $18,400 local high just a couple of days ago. The bears are gaining some important momentum, however, we still aren't ready to see a breakout or breakout move for mid and long term sentiment, which are likely taking a bit longer.

BTC has been ranging tightly over the last 24 hours, showing pretty much no upside or downside volatility, at least enough to have a solid breakout or breakdown move from our current level. $16,500 is currently serving as one of our most important short term key levels, which if held could get us the bullish continuation we were waiting for. Weekend volume about to end, meaning we're likely seeing stronger price action.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment has pretty much nose-dived over the last 72 hours, after BTC's move down from $18,400. On the other hand, current daily volume is extremely low, and not enough for the bulls or the bears to have a solid breakout or breakdown move in the next few weeks. Once we see sentiment gaining bullish or bearish strength, we're likely establishing a new multi month trend.

Several members of the U.S. Democratic Party and campaign committees are reportedly being probed by federal prosecutors over donations from former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and another executive of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange. “To any person, entity, or political campaign that has received stolen customer money, we ask that you work with us to return that money to the innocent victims,” said a U.S. district attorney following the arrest of Bankman-Fried.

December 20, 2022
➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
After reaching a $18,400 mid term high, BTC has nose-dived all the way down to a current $16,293 local low, from where is has seen a decent injection in bullish volume, sending it up to $17,000 (level around which we're currently trading). This short term bullish reaction may seem insignificant for now, however, considering the mid term higher high we've just printed, it could be the beginning of another leg up.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has gone from highly bearish to slightly bullish over the last 12 hours, and it's looking like it could gain even more momentum in the next few days if the bulls remain strong. Mid and long term sentiment haven't seen any important change yet, however, if the bulls manage to break above $18,500 and eventually $20,000, we're likely going to see a new explosion in higher time frame sentiment.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC s currently showing no increase in either bullish or bearish volume on lower or higher time frames, with ranging price action around $16,800. The bears have tried pushing prices once again to our local lows, however, buying support around this area remains strong, which means that we could potentially see a bullish continuation towards $18,500 or higher in the next couple of weeks.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Considering that we're around the corner of our yearly close, and that most traders are out for the holidays, we can clearly see a decrease in overall trading volume and general market interest, which will once again pick up the second week of 2023. In the meantime, short term sentiment remains slightly bullish while mid and long term sentiment are neutral.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC is still trading between its $15,500 and $18,500 mid term trading range, with one of the lowest overall daily volumes we've seen in the year, and the most neutral market conditions we've had in months. Our short term price action has tightened to the limit, meaning that we're likely ready for a breakout/breakdown confirmation move in the next few days or weeks.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment on pretty much every single time frame is currently neutral, and showing no signs of a definite breakout or breakout move for now. We've seen a tightening range of less than 2% for more than a couple of days, meaning we're likely about to see the start of another mid term market trend towards either new mid term lows or new mid term highs.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
The market is still ranging tightly between $16,500 and $17,000 on lower time frames, with no volume buildup either in favor of the bulls or in favor of the bears. Our key mid term support and resistance levels at $$15,500 and $18,500 remain untouched, and will be the levels responsible of confirming our next high volume significant move, which we're expecting in the next few weeks.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment remains neutral on pretty much all time frames, however, short term (intra-day) sentiment has seen a slight increase over the last 24 hours, due to an increase in alt-coin buying pressure and a slight decrease in BTC market dominance. If sentiment manages to climb even higher from its current levels, we could be seeing a full-blown mid term reversal catalyst.

Volume and volatility are pretty much dead on lower time frames for both BTC and higher market cap alts. BTC remains is one of its tightest short/mid term ranges it has seen in years just around $16,800 from where any small increase in volume or momentum, will likely confirm our next weekly move. This is expected to also drag the rest of the alt-coin market with it, either way it goes.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment on all time frames is currently extremely neutral, with absolutely no signs of either a breakdown or breakout. For an increase in bullish momentum, we need to see BTC breaking above at least $17,500, while the bears should gain short term strength and momentum with at least a break and close below $16,000.

Another person people are curious about these days is Alameda Research’s ex-co-CEO Sam Trabucco. The 30-year-old executive left Alameda in Aug. 2022, but since Ellison detailed misconduct happened in 2019, it’s assumed that Trabucco knows a thing or two about what happened.

Sentiment remains pretty much neutral on all time frames, however, it has seen a small drop over the last 24 hours, which could potentially aid the bears in pushing the market lower before the expected bounce we already mentioned.

BTC remains in the same mid term range we've been in for over a week, with tiny price action variation between $16,500 and $17,500. We can see that the bears have managed to push BTC down to $16,600 over the last couple of hours, however, their volume hasn't been enough for a much lower move yet. The bulls still need to see a clear break and close above $18,500 for confirmation.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Mid and long term sentiment are still neutral, and waiting for at least a few days worth of solid bearish or bullish price action before tilting in favor of either. Short term sentiment, on the other hand, has seen a small decrease favoring the bears, and this could become an even lower move in the next few days if support isn't found around $16,000 - $16,500.

**Bitcoin Bullets® Market Analysis**
December 29, 2022
➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
The bears have gained a bit of short term strength and momentum over the last 2 days, pushing BTC from $16,900 towards $16,500 with pretty much no intra-day support levels to hold price up. There's still no mid term confirmation for our next move, however, if the bears manage to push BTC below $16,000 on the daily, we’d likely see much lower levels over the next couple of weeks. 

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
On the other hand for the bulls, they need a quick comeback and regain of short term momentum towards at least $17,000 to confirm some short term upside. Our levels remain the same for now, meaning that if the bulls manage to get a break and close above $18,500 on the daily, we're likely heading much higher. Mid and long term sentiment remains neutral.

December 30, 2022

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Since yesterday, the bears have once again increased their short term momentum with a move towards $16,400, level around which we're still trading. With less than 2 days to our yearly close, we're expecting to see further volatility buildup, which could lead us to a mid term break to the upside or to the downside, on which we're going to be updating.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
General sentiment still remains neutral on higher time frames, with small variations on lower time frames. The bears have managed to push intra-day and short term sentiment in their favor, as total market cap has once again started falling, however, this move will mean nothing unless we see a break and close below $15,500 where we would see a downside acceleration towards new long term lows.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC remains stable and showing no signs of a short or mid term break to the upside or to the downside for now. Pice action has remained above $16,300 for now, level which has showed a very decent amount of local support. If we manage to stay above this level for the next couple of weeks, we're likely seeing higher levels, starting with $18,500.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Regardless of having just a few hours left of 2022, most time frames are currently completely neutral, waiting for either an upside or downside confirmation to once again gain momentum. Short term sentiment could see a clear direction around our yearly close in a few hours, which could become the catalyst for our next mid term move.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
We can see no important gain in either bullish or bearish volume for BTC and higher market cap alts even after our Yearly close, which shows the uncertain position in which the market is sitting right now. Until we see a solid break and close above $18,500 or below $15,500 we'll remain in this situation, however, we expect this to happen in no more than a couple of weeks, which will drag the rest of the market with it.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment is currently neutral on pretty much every single time frame for BTC and higher market cap alts, however, we've been able to see a couple of alts breaking out of their mid term ranges with strong buying action, which has pushing short term sentiment up slightly, and could potentially become the catalyst for an even stronger mid term reversal move.

After a second mid term retest of $16,400, BTC has once again picked up relative short term strength towards $16,700, which could be an early sign for a reversal, however, we do need confirmation above $18,500 for this. Alts are currently showing strength, with a couple fo Sicilian picks exploding towards new short term highs, which could be an early sign of what we're about to see.

BTC is still looking extremely neutral on higher time frames, showing no mid term potential either to the upside or to the downside for now. Our latest short term price action is showing that BTC has managed to bounce with decent strength from $16,350, a level that could become mid term support if we manage to break and close at least above $18,500.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
We've seen pretty much no change in our overall market sentiment on mid or long term, which means that big players are still waiting for confirmation before grabbing new positions on BTC and alts. Short term sentiment remains slightly bullish since our $16,350 bounce a few days ago, and it does have the potential of increasing even more in the next few days.

While most of the market remains neutral and silent, we can start seeing small but significant increases in volume for a couple of alts and smaller Sicilian picks.

Once again, mid and long term sentiment remain pretty much the same, with no important changes seen over the last few weeks, however, short term sentiment is starting to show some very slight but important signs of bullishness, which could end up getting us the overall market breakout we've already mentioned, enough to move BTC above $19,000 and alts to new short and potentially mid term highs.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC, ETH and most major high market cap alts currently remain neutral and showing no signs of a definite mid term breakout or breakdown. Price action for most alts is currently extremely choppy and our main mid/long term levels remain the same since last month, which is likely about to change. For BTC, a break below $16,000 will accelerate downside pressure and selling.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
On the other hand if sentiment manages to see an important increase in the mid term, extending towards higher time frames, we would likely explode above $18,500 in the next 2-3 weeks, with which we would confirm an even higher move, potentially reaching $21,100 as our next high relevance mid term resistance level. Mid/long term sentiment will likely see a significant move in the next few months.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
After once again retesting and rejecting $16,350 with decent volume to the upside, BTC has once again reached $17,000, level around which we're still trading and showing a potential higher move in the next couple of weeks. If the bulls manage to break and close above $18,500 on the daily with volume, we're likely starting a brand new upside move that could potentially take us towards $21,200 or even higher in a matter of a few weeks.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment remains neutral and stable in the mid and long term, with absolutely no changes in over a month, while short term sentiment is still bouncing back and forth with each day of price action, currently slightly bullish and showing signs of an intra-day bullish continuation for BtC< ETH and alts, which would be more than enough to reach our higher targets.

➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC and most of the market (higher market cap alts) remain stable and are still showing no signs of a decisive bullish or bearish mid term move for now. We're still ranging around $17,000 where overall trading volume remains extremely low and any small catalyst move will likely determine the fate of the market for the next couple of months at least. 

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Mid and long term sentiment remain extremely neutral and showing no signs of an upside or downside move for the next couple of days. Short term sentiment on the other side is also neutral, however, it's seeing short term variations to both the bull's and the bear's sides. We're likely not seeing and important sentiment confirmation until we get either a break above $18,500 or below $16,000.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Overall market cap and daily trading volume have exploded to new monthly highs over the last 24 hours, showing a level of strength we haven't seen in more than a month. BTC is currently trading above $17,000 which means the bulls have regained a decent amount of their short and mid term momentum. On the other hand, we still need a break and close above $18,500 for bullish confirmation.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has exploded in lower time frames, showing levels we haven't seen in months, while the bulls are still fighting with strength to regain their market dominance. Mid and long term sentiment are still very neutral, meaning that we still need a solid mid term move to the upside or to the downside to confirm our next significant move.

**Uncertainty Surrounds Federal Reserve's Future Plans for Rate Hikes**

The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised the benchmark bank rate seven times during the course of 2022, leading many to question when the central bank will cease or change course. The Fed has stated that it aims to bring inflation down to the 2% target, and the increases to the federal funds rate are intended to move toward this goal. However, Zoltan Pozsar, a U.S. macroeconomist and observer of the Fed, predicts that the central bank will start quantitative easing (QE) again by summer. Bill Baruch, an executive at Blue Line Futures, a futures and commodities brokerage firm, anticipates that the Fed will halt rate hikes by February.

Just as we told you for the past couple of weeks, the market has once again started to show signs of life and upside price action. BTC has finally broken above $17,000 where it has remained strong for the last couple of days, and looking for a potentially higher continuation in the next couple of weeks. We still haven't seen the confirmation we're looking fo above $18,500, however, we can expect this to change.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment for BTC and the overall market remains high and showing signs of potential mid term continuation in the next couple of weeks, which would also push mid and long term sentiment to new local highs. Once we see the upside confirmation we mentioned, we're likely seeing a sentiment explosion taking our current picks to new short and mid term highs.

The bulls are holding BTC above $17,000 with decent volume for now, which has been pretty much the first higher volume short term move in the next few months. If rhythm and volume for this move are held up with enough strength, we could be heading towards $18,500 next, above which we would have the mid term confirmation we're looking for. On the other hand a move below $15,500 would take us to much lower levels.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Bullish sentiment on lower time frames remains stable and showing signs of a potential continuation in the next couple of weeks. If we do see this short term continuation for BTC and the market overall, we're likely going to see bullish sentiment expanding once again towards mid and long term time frames. For this we still need confirmation, on which we'll be updating.

BTC has seen a very decent and high bullish momentum move over the last 2 weeks, reaching a current local high of $18,400 after our $16,300 swing low, making this a 12% upside move and looking for an even higher potential move in the next couple of weeks. Once BTC breaks and closes above $18,500 on the daily, we'll likely have a price action acceleration towards higher levels, on which we'll be updating.

Short term sentiment is currently very bullish, after a 2x increase in overall bullish volume in 2 weeks. Mid term sentiment remains relatively neutral along long term sentiment, however, we're seeing mid term sentiment starting to tilt in favor of the bulls, which could mean that we're just getting started with a much, much higher move.

Short term sentiment has exploded even higher over the last 24 hours, and mid term sentiment has once again started to pick up in favor of the bulls.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Mid term key levels for BTC have been slightly readjusted after our latest move to the upside, showing that BTC has found a very strong resistance level around $21,200, and this could mean we're in for a short/mid term correction before a much higher move in the next couple of months. Our most important level remains at $18,500, which must be held for this move.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment has completely exploded in the short and mid term, reaching new multi-month highs and showing the biggest potential we've seen in over a year. If strength continues to build up for BTC and the rest of the market, we can expect to reach even higher mid term highs for BTC and alts, pushing long term sentiment to new highs and potentially starting a new market cycle.

January 15, 2023
➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC perfectly reached our $21,174 key mid term resistance level before heading slightly down where we're currently ranging. If this level is not broken in the next 5-7 days, we can very much expect t see a short/mid term correction towards $20,000 or even $18,800 before a continuation bounce towards new mid term highs, on which we'll be updating.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Mid term sentiment remains very strong and in place after our latest upside move. Long term sentiment still need confirmation to regain bullish momentum, however, it's currently tilting slightly in favor of the bulls. Short term sentiment is showing some signs of bearishness and could mean we're about to see a local correction.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Just around our daily close yesterday, BTC reached yet another mid term higher high at $21,400, which cleared even higher multi-month liquidity before heading once again below our $21,170 mid term key level. Judging by our current price action, we could expect BTC to retest $20,000 in the next couple of days before an even stronger continuation move, on which we'll also be updating.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Mid term sentiment remains slightly bullish for the overall market, however long term sentiment remains neutral, and is waiting for either a higher confirmation to favor the bulls or for a long term breakdown to favor the bears. Short term sentiment has tilted in favor of the bears over the last couple of weeks, and this could become the catalyst for our next move.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC has once again gained a decent amount of intra-day strength with its latest move from $20,600 up to $21,300 (level around which we're currently ranging). This has given the bulls yet another much in confidence and could lead our next move if we manage to see a solid daily close above at least $21,200. The bears, on the other hand, are looking for a break and close below $20,000 for a mid term bearish move down.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short and mid term sentiment are currently bullish, showing signs of strength on pretty much every single time frame. Long term sentiment remains neutral, however, if BTC manages to see an even stronger move above $24,000 in the next couple of weeks, we could see long term sentiment tilting in favor of the bulls once again.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC has been printing higher local highs and lows over the last week, showing a considerable amount of bullish strength ad a potential to move higher in the next few weeks if enough momentum is built and maintained. We could, however, see a short term correction move from our current ranges before a stronger bounce, which we'll be updating on.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment is currently higher bullish, along mid term sentiment. Long term sentiment remains relatively neutral, however, the bulls are starting to gain an edge on all time frames. The bears have lost pretty much all dominance in the market in terms of sentiment, which could become the catalyst for our next considerable market move up.

BTC has been struggling over the last 24 hours to maintain above $21,000 which has for the last few weeks been our most important support/resistance key level for BTC. It currently looks like we're getting ready for a much lower market correction in the next couple of days, before a considerable BTC and alt-coin bounce, on which we'll be updating everyone.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has now become bearish, as BTC's price has once again seen a retest of $20,400 from where we still have two options. If BTC manages to see a solid break and close above $21,500 from here, we're likely heading much higher without any correction, however, If BTC breaks and closes once again below $18,500, we're in for a much deeper correction.

Just as expected, and just as The Sicilian had been telling everyone over the last week, the BTC bulls have gained even further mid term strength and volume, pushing us towards a current $23,300 high and still showing potential to head higher after a grab of downside liquidity. We've perfectly retested our $23,150 mid term resistance level meaning we could head towards $21,000 - $21,500 for a retest now.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short and mid term sentiment have exploded over the last 24 hours, as BTC and alts have exploded to even higher mid and long term highs. We can very much see a long term bullish continuation from here, however, for this we do need a lower liquidity grab from where the bulls would regain the strength they need for a higher move, and on which we'll be updating.

After perfectly reaching and retesting our $23,185 key mid term level, BTC has been twice rejected and brought back down below $23,000 where we're still trading. The bulls have shown exceptional strength over the last week, and we could very much see a bullish continuation from our current levels, however, weekend price action and volume could also get us a short/mid term correction before this upside move.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has become neutral over the last 24 hours, after seeing BTC dropping once again below $23,000 and showing no signs of another retest for now. Mid term sentiment remains slightly bullish, meaning that we could see a continuation move to the upside in the next couple of weeks, for which we'll be more than ready. Long term sentiment remains neutral.

January 23, 2023
➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC is currently ranging with decent mid term strength above $22,000, after reaching a local high of $23,300 and pushing pretty much the entire market up along with it. Depending on the price action we see in the next couple of days, we'll determine where the market is headed for the next couple of weeks and potentially months. With a break and close below $22,000, the bears would regain dominance. 

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has decreased over the last 2 days, after having BTC show very strong resistance at around $23,000, which could either push prices lower over the next couple of days (dragging sentiment down along with it) or manage to push through this key resistance level towards $24,000 or higher which would in turn create another alt push to the upside.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Currently holding above $22,560, BTC is looking relatively stable on higher time frames, with a potential to head higher over the next couple of weeks if the bulls manage to hold on to their bullish momentum. Our most important mid term support level is currently as $21,174, which must hold in order to get a bullish continuation from here. Our most important mid term resistance remains at $24,000.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment remains in favor of the bulls on short and mid term time frames, which cold lead to a continuation move, however, long term sentiment remains neutral and does need a much stronger confirmation move to tilt either in favor of the bulls or the bears. With a drop below $21,000 we would see a drop in both mid and short term sentiments, with a potential of seeing another bearish continuation.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC is currently trading around $22,500 with decent mid term strength maintained from our move up from $16,000 to $23,500. We're retesting our local $22,564 support which will determine if we're heading towards $25,000 or to $22,000 from here in the next few days. Depending on how price action develops over the next couple of days we’ll see a strong upside or downside move which we'll catch, as always.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has dropped considerable over the last 24 hours, giving a slight advantage to the bears, which could mean we're heading towards $22,000 or lower from here if the bears manage to gain even further strength. Mid term sentiment remains bullish and long term sentiment remains neutral, meaning that we haven't yet confirmed our next high relevance and high volume move.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC had been ranging in a relatively tight short term range between $22,500 and $23,500 for the last week, with small variations to the upside and to the downside, while the bulls were still showing significant mid term dominance over the bears in the mid term. Yesterday, the bulls managed to see a move above this range to a $23,800 high, from where it got immediately rejected by the bears.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
This mid short term reaction above our range has sent short term. sentiment down to new local lows, which could give the bears enough strength for a lower retest before another considerable bounce. Mid term sentiment, however, remains bullish, and as long as price action remains above $21,000, the bulls will hold this edge.

BTC remains relatively stable around $23,000 with no spikes of trading volume in favor of the bulls of the bears. Intra-day price action looks like it's going to have some chop before determining where price action is really headed for in th mid term. ETH is also trading just below $1,600, which is one of its most important mid term resistance levels, at least until it sees a clean break through it.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has gone from slightly bearish yesterday to neutral today, which can be clearly seen in most alts, which have seen little to no variation in terms of price action over the last 24 hours. On the other hand, mid term sentiment remains slightly bullish, and this could be the catalyst for our next high volume move to the upside.

With BTC once again trading above $23,000 and showing exceptional signs of short term volume and strength, we could be getting ready for a higher move in the next few weeks, which could potentially reach $25,200 or higher if even more bullish strength is gained. The bears need to see a weekly close below $23,200 to head lower, which currently looks unlikely.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short and mid term sentiment have turned bullish over the last 24 hours, with strength and volume being gained and accelerated. Bullish momentum could take us above $25,000 in the next few days or weeks, which could potentially be enough to see long term sentiment turning once again bullish, and starting a new market cycle.

BTC and the whole maker overall had been gaining an important amount of bullish momentum over the weekend, pushing BTC to a $24,000 swing high, from where the bulls started to once again gain strength, pushing BTC down to $23,000. We're still ranging around this level, however, we can expect to see a stronger move in the next couple of days, either a bounce to new mid term highs or a lower correction.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has once again turned bearish over the last 24 hours, and could get us a lower short/mid term retest before another potential bounce in the next few weeks. Our most important Mid Term support level for now lies at $22,500, which will likely be retested before another move up. Mid term sentiment remains slightly bullish and long term sentiment remains neutral, and awaiting for stronger confirmation.

January 31, 2023
➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC has managed to perfectly retest our $22,564 key local level, from where we've seen a very decent short term bullish reaction towards $23,000, however, BTC is not out of danger yet. If the bears manage to push BTC below $22,500 on the daily, we could see a much lower mid term retest before a potential high volume bounce.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment remains bearish considering the last 2 days have been gained pretty much completely by the bears, with our move down from $24,000. Mid term sentiment remains bullish, still holding power and strength from our upside move from $16,000 and long term sentiment is still looking neutral, waiting for either a strong upside confirmation or a bearish continuation.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
After our January monthly close, BTC has once again bounced towards $23,000 where we're currently trading with decent short term strength. We’re still to see a mid term confirmation for either the bulls or the bears, which we expect to happen in the next couple of weeks, and will either break above $23,500 towards $25,000 or below $22,550 towards $22,000 or potentially lower.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has turned pretty much neutral over he last 48 hours, after having the market show pretty much no decisiveness in favor of either the bulls or the bears. Mid term sentiment remains relatively strong, with a potential to take us higher in the next weeks, and long term sentiment remains neutral, awaiting patiently for a higher time frame confirmation.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Once again gaining bullish strength on lower time frames, BTC has managed to reach a new local high of $24,270 (above our key $23,185 key mid term support and resistance level). If strength is maintained by the bulls for the next couple of hours, we're very likely heading even higher over the next couple of days, potentially reaching new highs above $25,500.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has once again exploded, and combined with a relatively bullish mid term overall sentiment, we could see a strong continuation towards the upside in the next few weeks, for which we'll be more than ready, and could turn the tables once again in favor of the bulls on the long term.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Over the last 24 hours, BTC has seen a 4% drop from our $24,240 mid term highs down to $23,200, level around which we're still trading now. This move has also pushed most higher market cap alts towards new short term lows, however, the overall market remains stable and BTC has not even gotten close to its key mid term support level at $23,000, which must hold in order to maintain mid term strength.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has been looking like a rollercoaster over the last 2 weeks, reaching new local highs and new local lows pretty much every couple of days, and while it's currently slightly bearish after our latest drop, mid term sentiment remains considerably bullish and could be responsible for our next high volume move. Long term sentiment is still to be determined.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Weekend volume once again kicking in for BTC and the overall market (which means a significant drop to our daily volume yesterday), however, the market still remain stable and BTC is currently holding above our $23,185 key mid term support level with enough strength and volume. The bulls have built a decent amount of mid term momentum over the last few weeks, and his could mean a continuation.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment is currently pretty much neutral, while mid term sentiment remains slightly bullish, which means that the bulls have a slight edge over the the bears for our next move. If the bears manage to see a daily close below $22,500, short and mid term sentiment would tilt in favor of the bears, and would potentially take us lower towards $21,000 for another retest.

BTC has remained relatively quiet over the weekend, with just a slight amount of volume and lower time frame momentum gained by the bears, with BTC's move towards our key $23,000 mid term support level, around which we've held relatively well, however, if we see a daily and weekly close below $23,150, we could very much set new mid term lows in the next few weeks, before another bounce.

BTC has managed to remain strong despite the short term chop we saw around our weekly close, holding above our most important mid term key level for now at $22,800, which if held for the next couple of days, would take us straight to new local high. If th bears, however, manage to get a break and close on the daily below $22,500, we could be in for a lower correction before a mid term bounce.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment has increased slightly on the short term over the last 24 hours, becoming pretty much neutral after respecting our already mentioned key mid term support level. Mid term sentiment remains considerably bullish, and we could see long term sentiment turning in favor of the bulls in the next couple of weeks if buyers once again step in.

**FTX Debtors Demand Return of Funds Given to US Politicians and Super PACs**

FTX debtors are seeking to claw back millions of dollars given to U.S. political action committees (PACs) and political figures. Confidential letters have been sent to individuals and organizations, requesting the return of the funds by Feb. 28, 2023. Some bureaucrats, such as Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Tina Smith, have already pledged the funds to charity. It is uncertain whether they will be required by law to repay the funds to the now-bankrupt FTX estate.

➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Since our initial break and close above $22,000 18 days ago, BTC has remained stable and relatively strong, with no deviation below this key level since then. The bulls have attempted a couple of breaks above $24,000, however, none of them was eventually successful, which means that we're still in range and waiting for a stronger and higher volume confirmation, which should happen in the next couple of weeks.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has increased over the last 24 hours, however, it remains relatively neutral. Mid term sentiment once again remains neutral, however, it has seen a constant decrease over the last 2 weeks considering no continuation move up has been confirmed. Long term sentiment is still neutral and waiting for a higher volume move, which shouldn't take long either.

➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
After multiple short and mid term retests, we've seen our $22,800 key mid term level broken to the downside with relative volume. This break and close below has managed to hold over the last couple of 4H closes, meaning that the bears could gain even further momentum over the next few days, with $22,000 and $21,500 being our next key support levels. For the bulls, a break and close above $23,000 is still required.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has seen extreme levels of chop over the last couple of days, currently sitting at one of the most neutral spots we've seen in weeks. Even though short term sentiment could become bearish if the bears gain further momentum, mid term sentiment remains bullish, and will likely eventually get us a decent bounce in the next 1-2 weeks.

BTC has broken down our key mid term support at $22,800 with decent short term volume, which has created a wave of sellers once again entering the market, pushing BTC down to $21,700 where we're trading and waiting for our next increase in volume for our next confirmation. We could see a $21,300 retest in the next couple of hours, from where we do expect a short term bounce.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short and mid term sentiment have turned considerably bearish over the last 48 hours, specially with other coin imploding and showing 5-10% drops. Long term sentiment remains neutral and looking for a higher volume and strength move fo confirmation which should be either below $20,500 for the bears or above $24,000 for the bulls.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
With the weekend once again bringing on its classic lower volume trading session, we can see some upcoming chop for the next couple of days, until our weekly close. For now, the bears remain strong on lower time frames, after breaking and closing below our key $22,800 mid term support. For now, the bulls should be looking to hold at least above $21,300 for a continuation.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short and mid term sentiment have turned bearish over the last couple of days, looking like it could head a bit lower before our weekly close tomorrow, which could either take us to a much lower breakdown or to a high volume bounce towards our current swing highs above $24,000. Long term sentiment remains neutral and looking like it has no intentions to change for now, at least until we see a much higher volume confirmation.

BTC currently trading between $21,500 and $22,000, where it has seen a decent short term bullish reaction over the last couple of hours, after bouncing from our local $21,400 low.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has gone from heavily bearish in the last couple of days to neutral, after finding a decent support above $21,000. Mid term sentiment has started to once again become neutral, after several weeks of holding up in favor of the bulls. Long term sentiment, as you already know, is still waiting for a higher volume confirmation

Mid term sentiment remains slightly bullish but quickly becoming neutral, and long term sentiment is still waiting for a higher volume move.

Short and mid term sentiment have once again exploded with our latest move, reaching levels not seen since our previous move up from $16,000.

February 17, 2023
➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC has perfectly reached its $25,195 key mid term resistance level yesterday, with volume and strength that we hadn’t seen since our previous move up from $16,000. After retesting this level, however, we saw a quick bearish rejection taking us towards $23,500, around which we're currently trading and waiting for our next gain in volume and momentum to confirm where we're headed for the week.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment remains high, however, our $25,000 rejection has pushed it down a bit. Mid term sentiment on the other hand remains highly bullish and could be the responsible factor for our next significant move to the upside. Long term sentiment remains neutral, however, it's currently leaning in favor of the bulls, meaning that we could see a much higher move in the next few months.

February 18, 2023

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Price action for BTC has seen a very significant increase in chop over the last 24 hours, with its latest move from $25,000 down to $23,500 and back up towards $25,000 where we're currently trading. This last move has also sent most higher market cap alts up towards new mid term highs, and is showing a potential to head even higher over the next couple of weeks if strength is held and maintained.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has once again increased, along mid term sentiment, reaching previous highs and potentially becoming the catalyst for a higher continuation bullish move. As for long term sentiment, it's patiently waiting on the slightly bullish neutral side of the spectrum, which will likely explode if we see a solid break and close above $25,000.

➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC is currently trading around $24,500 after reaching a $25,200 twin peak from where it has been once again rejected to the downside. The bears are currently dominant on lower time frames and looking to reach lower levels for BTC and alts, which could happen before our next mid erm move up.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment on lower time frames has dropped considerably after reaching our second double top, and if we manage to see a bearish daily close below $24,000, we'd likely see mid term sentiment also decreasing to a less bullish level. Long term sentiment, as we've already updated remains neutral and waiting for a stronger confirmation either above $25,500 or below our previous $16,000 long term lows.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC currently trading around $24,700 with decent lower time frame strength, after retesting sub $24,000 levels yesterday. It looks like the bulls are once again regaining mid term strength, however, in order to confirm a higher upside move, we must see a solid high volume break and close above our previous $25,200 highs. In case of another rejection, we're likely heading lower once again.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has once again increased, tilting in favor of the bulls decently and showing signs of a potential mid term continuation, however, we still need that solid confirmation above $25,00 for this move to happen. On the other hand, mid term sentiment remains relatively strong and showing signs of general uncertainty after our latest chop.

With a break and close below $24,000, we would see a mid term continuation down towards likely $23,000 or lower before a bounce.

Short term sentiment has once again imploded, heading pretty much completely in favor of the bears and holding a decent amount of overall bearish pressure. Mid term sentiment on the other hand remains bullish, as long as we hold above $24,000, however, a break and close below would make it neutral before potentially turning it bearish again.

Once again we can see that the bears on BTC have gained a decent amount of strength with our latest key $23,800 retest (level around which we're still trading). If the bears manage to gain enough strength for a solid 4H break and close below this level, we're likely heading much lower over the next few days. Remaining above on higher time frames, and we head much, much higher.

Current short term sentiment has decreased slightly over the last 24 hours, with our retest of the mentioned key level, however, it wont see a significant bearish move unless we see a solid break and close below it. On the other hand, mid term sentiment remains bullish and long term sentiment neutral, which means we're still holding strong.

BTC once again retesting $23,000 as one of its most important mid term support levels, from where we're likely seeing some short term chop before our next high volume move. If the bears manage to see a break and close below $22,800 we could be heading lower over the next few weeks with $21,500 and $20,500 as our next most important support levels.

Short term sentiment has turned bearish over the last couple of hours, after the steep drop we saw from $25,000, which has also pushed mid term sentiment lower, which for now remains slightly bullish. Long term sentiment remains neutral and waiting for a higher volume confirmation, which is expected to happen in the next couple of months.

February 26, 2023
➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC has reached yet another local lower low at $22,800, which has cleared some more downside liquidity before seeing a pretty decent short term bounce above this key level. For now, $22,800 is our most important mid term level for BTC, because it will determine if we're headed towards $25,000 again or we're going for a $20,500 retest over the next couple of days/weeks.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has decreased slightly over the last 24 hours, lower than it has after dropping from our local $25,400 highs. Mid term sentiment remains bullish, however, if we do see a break and close below $20,500 over the next couple of weeks, we’re likely seeing mid term sentiment moving in favor of the bears. Long term sentiment, as for more than a few months, remains neutral.

February 27, 2023

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Chop over the last couple of days has sent BTC down to new local lows below $23,000 yesterday, from where we've seen a decent lower time frame bounce towards $23,500 where we're currently trading. Our weekly close favored neither the bulls nor the bears in the bigger picture, however, if we see a solid daily break and close above $23,800, we're likely heading higher over the next few weeks.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
On the other hand, considering that lower time frame sentiment remains in favor of the bears, we could see a break and close below $22,800 on the daily, which would take us to a $21,500 or lower retest before once again bouncing to new mid term highs. Mid term sentiment remains bullish, while long term sentiment rests neutral.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC is currently ranging around $23,000 after bouncing between $22,500 and $23,500 for the last couple of days with an increased level of volatility and chop that we haven't seen in a few weeks. Depending on what we see in terms of price action over the next couple of days and weeks, we'll determine where price action is headed, which will be either to new mid term highs above $25,000 or once again to $21,000.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has become neutral due to our current levels of chop and volatility, with no clear confirmation in favor of the bulls or the bears. Mid term sentiment remains relatively bullish and long term sentiment remains neutral and waiting for a stronger and higher volume confirmation which we expect to see in no more than a few months.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
Even though we saw a pretty violent and high volume mid term drop from our $25,200 highs down to $22,800 over the last couple of days, we're still holding relative bullish momentum and strength in the mid term, and as long as BTC's price action remains above $21,500, we’ll likely see a mid term continuation from here, expected to reach at least $25,000.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentient for BTC has once again turned bullish, increasing rapidly after our bounce up from sub $23,000 levels. Mid term sentient remains bullish, after our initial higher time frae move up from $16,000 and long term sentiment is still neutral, which means that we're waiting for either a higher volume move up or down for confirmation.

After moving down towards our $22,100 key mid term support level, BTC has remained pretty much stable around this level, with little to no variation for the last 12 hours. We've seen a pretty steep overall volume drop in this timeframe, which means that there's currently a higher than usual uncertainty level in the market, but we should be able to confirm a move int he next 1-2 weeks.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment remains relatively low after price action for the last few days, which is expected to change after our next higher volume move to the upside or to the downside, once new volume is gained by the market. Mid term sentiment is currently slightly bullish, however, it's getting closer and closer to a completely neutral level.

Over the last week, BTC has seen a 12% drop from our local high above $25,000, settling around $23,000 where we're currently trading. We're still above one of our most important key mid term levels at $21,100, however, uncertainty between bulls and bears combined with a higher than usual lower time frame chop could be risky for the mid term.

Short term sentiment has increased from the negative levels i reached over the last 2 days, becoming pretty much neutral. Mid term sentiment has become slightly bearish considering the drop from our local highs and long term sentiment remains stable and neutral until we see the higher time frame confirmation we've already mentioned.

March 6, 2023
➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
We've seen pretty much no change in either price action or volume over the least couple of days, even after our first weekly close of the month. Both the bulls and the bears remain silent and apparently waiting for confirmation before once again entering larger positions. Chop and volatility expected, for which we'll be ready.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment remains neutral, considering our current market structure and price action. Mid term sentiment is currently slightly bullish considering our price action over the last few months, and long term sentiment, as it has been for months, remains neutral and waiting for higher volume confirmation.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC remains in its $22,000 - $22,700 short term range for almost a week now, and we haven't seen any important signs of a break to the upside or to the downside in the mid term. Depending on how price action behaves over the next couple of days, we'll determine our next high volume move.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment has stalled on pretty much all time frames, becoming neutral on lower time frames and still holding some of its initial bullish momentum in the mid term, however, any side could gain an important advantage from here, depending on where we head in the next couple of days and weeks.

➖➖➖➖➖
⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC has seen a slight increase in lower time frame selling pressure over the last 24 hours, which means that the bears have managed to push price action from $22,400 down to $22,000 where we're currently trading. We're currently trading below our $22,100 key mid term level, which means we could see a lower correction before bouncing.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentient has tilted in favor of the bears over the last 24 hours, showing a potential lower mid term correction before finding a high interest support level from where we'd bounce towards new local or mid term highs. Mid term sentiment remains relatively stable and long term sentiment unchanged.

BTC is currently trading around $21,500 with a slight lower time frame increase in bearish momentum, which could take us a bit lower for a mid term retest before a higher volume bounce. $21,200 is currently our next mid term support level, which will likely be retested in the next couple of hours.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has imploded once again, going from neutral to bearish in a matter of 24 hours, which could get us an even lower move in the next couple of weeks. Mid term sentiment remains neutral, expecting a higher volume move for confirmation, same as with long term sentiment.

BTC has broken down completely on lower time frames, reaching a current local low of $19,800 and looking like it could head even lower before a stronger bounce. the entire market has been following BtC in terms of price action, meaning higher and lower market cap alts have also dropped considerably.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has imploded, reaching new multi-month lows and showing an even lower bearish potential for the next couple of weeks. Depending on what we see over the next couple of weeks, we'll determine where long term sentiment is headed, however, for now, BTC and the overall market look extremely weak.

After gaining a much higher than expected bullish momentum over the last couple of days, BTC briefly broke above our $25,200 long term key resistance level, before heading straight down once again. We're now trading around $24,500, expecting another increase in volume.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short and mid term sentiment have exploded in favor of the bulls over the last couple of days, which could be the catalyst for our next higher time frame long term move. Long term sentiment is currently starting to tilt in favor of the bulls, and getting ready for what could be another move.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
After reaching yet another mid term high at $26,500, BTC has been pushed down to $24,000 by the bears, who have once again gained short term strength. Volume has dropped considerably over the last couple of days, meaning that buyers are still in the market, but waiting for confirmation.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment is currently neutral, and could see a gain in momentum in favor of the bulls with a daily close above $25,000. Mid term sentiment is highly bullish, after our violent and high volume move to from sub $20,000 levels, while long term sentiment is waiting for a solid confirmation, which could get us the start of another market cycle.

Credit Suisse has experienced a loss of confidence in the financial institution’s health following a significant drop in its shares’ value this week. Over the past five days, Credit Suisse shares have fallen 24.34% against the U.S. dollar, eroding trust amid fears about the global banking system. On Wednesday at around 9 p.m. (ET), Credit Suisse announced that it was strengthening its liquidity by borrowing 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss National Bank (SNB).

**SEC Informs Crypto Exchange Coinbase of Potential Securities Law Violations**

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sent Coinbase a “Wells notice” about potential violations of securities law. The Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange noted that, unlike what SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said, the securities regulator “will not let crypto companies ‘come in and register.'” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong explained: “A Wells notice typically precedes an enforcement action.”

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC has see one final move up towards $29,300 yesterday, which has pretty much instantly rejected before having the bears push price action back down to $27,000 around which we're still trading. Depending on how the market reacts over the next couple of days, we'll determine our next mid term move.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has dropped considerably along BTC's price over the last 24 hours, which could see a continuation over the next couple of days. Mid term sentiment remains relatively bullish, however, we've also seen a drop over the last couple of days. Long term sentiment remains strong, however, we could see a move back to neutral in the next couple of weeks.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC currently trading just around our $27,800 key mid term level, where it has found a decent amount of support. Depending on what we see over the next couple of weeks, we'll determine the direction the overall market will be taking for the next few months, and we'll be updating accordingly.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has become relatively neutral over the last couple of days, while mid and long term sentiment have remained bullish. We could see a higher time frame bullish continuation for BTC and the overall market in the next few days, however, we're still waiting for confirmation on this.

BTC has seen no important price change over the last 24 hours, regardless of having a brand new weekly open and an expected increase in trading volume. We're still trading around $27,000 - $28,500 with relative mid term indecision. Depending on if we see a break and close above $29,000 or below $27,000 for confirmation.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Sentiment remains pretty much the same, however, short term sentiment has seen a small increase over the last 24 hours, which isn't significant enough yet for a breakout move, however it could expand in the next few days. Mid and long term sentiment remain in favor of the bulls.

BTC still trading around $28,000 while both the bulls and the bears are fighting for control on lower time frames. We can expect to see an increase in volatility from our current levels, which would shakeout over-leveraged players from both sides before another important move.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
While overall sentiment is becoming neutral in anticipation for our next high volume move, we can expect to see a new gain in bearish momentum if BTC breaks and closes below $26,000, or a strong gain in bullish momentum if BTC crosses and stays above $30,000 on the daily. Long term sentiment remains stable and waiting for confirmation.

We can clearly see that volatility on BTC and a couple of other higher market cap alts (including ETH and LTC) has decreased considerably on lower time frames. BTC remains trading around $28,000, which has become our new mid term neutral level, and will be the starting point of our next high volume move.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has become neutral, while mid and long term sentiment remain relatively bullish (specially mid term sentiment). Sentiment for the next couple of weeks and months will depend on BTC heading above $30,000 with a solid close or below $26,500, on which we'll be updating.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC has clearly broken and closed above our most important higher time frame $29,344 resistance level, which had been holding off price action for almost a year. Now that we're once again trading above $30,000, we could very much see an overall market continuation towards new mid and long term highs.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Depending on what we see in the mid term, we'll see sentiment following suit, however, for now, short and mid term sentiment are fully bullish, and looking for a higher move, while long term sentiment is bullish (decently) with a potential to reach higher if we see a higher break. A correction is still possible before bouncing higher.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC has broken with strength and volume above $30,000, as you already know, however, we can’t see bears anywhere around to push it down, meaning we've been holding above $30,000 for a while now, and we could expect to even see a continuation if this continues. We'll be updating, as always, on the most profitable move.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short and mid term sentiment have become highly bullish over the last couple of days, with BTC and a couple of top alts heading towards ne w mid and long term highs. Depending on if we maintain this momentum and strength, we'll determine where long term sentiment is headed in the next couple of months.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC has reached yet another long term high of $31,000 over the last 24 hours, from where we've faced a considerable amount of lower time frame resistance and selling pressure, which could potentially push us lower before a considerable mid term bounce. Depending on what we see over the next few days, we'll determine our next high volume mid term move.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has pretty much peaked over the last couple of days, from where we've historically seen decent short and mid term corrections, which could very much happen this week. Mid term sentiment remains relatively bullish along long term sentiment, however, we do need a higher and stronger confirmation for this last one.

We're currently trading below our key $29,300 long term level, which means that the bears have the chance to visit lower levels before a higher volume bounce.

⚪️**SENTIMENT**
Short term sentiment has decreased even more over the last couple of hours, which could also affect mid term sentiment in the next couple of days if the bears gain traction and volume. Depending on where price action is heading, we'll determine higher time frame sentiment for the next couple of months.

If the bulls regain mid and long term strength, we'd see another break and close on the daily above $29,500.

After our weekly close, BTC bears have started gaining short term momentum and strength, pushing us from a local high of $29,800 towards $27,500 around which we're currently trading. If we see further increase in bearish momentum over the next couple of days, we can very much expect to see a $26,000 retest before another bounce.

**Bitcoin Network Overwhelmed by 390,000 Unconfirmed Transactions and Surging Fees**

In just under two weeks, the number of unconfirmed transactions on the Bitcoin network has skyrocketed from 134,000 to over 390,000, causing a bottleneck in the mempool. This surge in unconfirmed transactions has resulted in a staggering 343% increase in transaction fees, which have risen from $1.99 per transaction on April 26 to a current rate of $8.82 per transaction as of May 7. Bitcoin miners are struggling to keep up with the demand, leaving many users frustrated and unable to complete their transactions in a timely manner.

Daily chop has increased considerably over the last 24 hours, with BTC liquidating both over-leveraged bulls and bears with its latest move. We're very likely getting ready for a much higher volume and violent move int he next couple of days/weeks, which will either confirm a BTC break below $25,500 or above $32,000, and for which we'll be more than ready before anyone else.

BTC has once again gained decent short term strength after retesting sub $26,000 levels and bouncing with local strength towards $27,000 just around we're currently trading now. Most of the market is currently showing at least slight green for the day, meaning that a weekly continuation is possible, depending on what we see around our weekly close in the next  24 hours.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
After the 17% correction from our swing highs at $31,000 down to $25,800 (which we retested just a few days back), BTC has once again started to gain some strength, reaching $27,500 and potentially getting ready for a higher move, however we need confirmation above at least $28,000 before. The bears need a break and close below $26,000 for confirmation.

**Breaking: Argentine Central Bank Raises Interest Rate by 97%, Good Case for Bitcoin?**

The Central Bank of Argentina has announced a further increase in its base interest rate to 97% in response to soaring inflation in what has been tipped as a win for Bitcoin (BTC). With inflation reaching almost 109% on a year-on-year basis in April, this is the second time the government is taking such hawkish measures to address this issue in recent times.

BTC is currently trading around $27,000, showing a small short term support above $26,800 which could lead us to a stronger mid term bounce in the next couple of days/weeks. We'll determine this with a mid term confirmation above $28,000, which would also take most higher market cap alts up along with it.

We could see a break towards $28,000 in the next couple of days, which would confirm a mid term higher, potentially reaching $30,000 or higher. A break below $25,000 would take us much lower on the other hand.

⚪️**TECHNICAL (4H)**
BTC has seen a short term downturn over the last 24 hours, reaching a current local low of $25,878, from where it was once again quickly bought up to $26,200 where we're currently trading. The bulls still need to see a solid break and close above $28,000 to confirm a higher move.

BTC currently trading just above our $25,880 support level, which if respected for the next couple of daily closes, we'd be very likely seeing a bullish move towards $28,000 before wither being rejected and heading back down to sub $26,000 levels or breaking out on higher time frames towards $29,500 and higher.

BTC has once again gained local strength, bouncing from its $25,900 local low towards $27,000. If price action holds above $27,000 for the next 12 hours, we can expect to see an even more explosive and high volume move for both BTC and alts, which for now is the likely scenario.

**China's Credit Agency Downgrades US Credit Rating Over Debt-Ceiling Standoff and Looming Default**

China’s oldest credit rating agency, Chengxin International Credit Rating (CCXI), made headlines this week by downgrading the United States’ credit rating. The agency lowered the rating from AAAg to AAg+ and attributed this decision to the escalating political discord, rising inflation, and the ongoing impasse over the debt ceiling.

BTC has seen a very solid bullish move of 10% from $26,000 up to $28,500 in a matter of just over a day, which has also taken our Sicilian alts towards new short and mis term highs making us incredible profits.

After reaching a perfect retest high of $28,400, BTC has seen a steep lower time frame drop towards $27,000, where it's currently trading and showing no signs of local support for now. We could very likely see a lower move towards $26,000 in the next few hours before a bounce, which we'll be ready to catch.

**Chinese Yuan to Replace US Dollar as World's Reserve Currency, Says Russian Banker**

Russia’s second-largest bank’s chairman says there is every reason to expect the Chinese yuan to replace the U.S. dollar as the world’s main reserve currency. He highlighted that the central bank of Russia has already begun investing its reserves in yuan, and over 70% of the trade turnover between Russia and China is settled in yuan along with the ruble.

Just around our monthly close 14 hours ago, BTC saw a slight bearish move from $27,200 towards sub $27,000 levels, reaching a current local low of $26,650, and gaining the bears a decent amount of strength and momentum. Overall daily volume has decreased, meaning that no solid mid term move has been confirmed yet. The bulls still need a break and close above $29,500 for confirmation.

Just kicking off our new month, witch BTC regaining slight upside momentum again. The bulls have managed to push price action above $27,000 with decent strength on lower time frames, however, a stronger confirmation above $28,000 is still necessary for the bulls to gain our next mid term move.

In the meantime, we’re perfectly catching all the most profitable moves, both the best long and short, before any other traders even realize, and that’s what makes us the best😉

Regardless of the higher chop and volatility we saw in May, The Sicilian (our top trader since 2018), has managed to score all our VIP members a total monthly profit of 5,367.8%, which adjusted for position becomes over 760% of overall account profits for May!! 🚀🚀

Just after reaching a daily high of $27,200 yesterday, BTC saw and extremely violent and pretty much instant 7% drop towards $25,680, due to the news that the SEC was suing Binance Exchange and its CEO, CZ for ilegal services provided in the US, through unregulated securities. Expecting an increase in chop, for now the bears remain in control.

BTC has once again gained bullish momentum from sub $26,000 levels, reaching a new local high of $27,300 and ranging around $27,000 which means we could see a higher move in the next couple of days if the bulls hold on to their strength and break above $27,000 on the daily. On the other hand, if the bears once again manage to take BTC below $26,000, we'd be in for a lower correction.

Depending on the reaction we see around this level, we'll either see a break above $28,000 and alts exploding or we'll see an even lower move below $25,200, and most alts seeing new long term lows before potential bounces.

BTC has remained stable after our weekly close, which has managed to be above $25,500, which could potentially lead to a mid term bounce for BTC and higher market cap alts in the next 1-2 weeks. If on the other hand the bears regain mid term volume and move towards $25,000, with a solid break and close below on the daily, we’d be heading straight to $24,000 before a bounce.

BTC holding above $25,000 which means the bulls still have a decent probability of seeing a bounce from here, only if we gain momentum above $26,000, which would take BTC up to $26,800 and potentially higher. If the bears, on the other hand, break and close below $25,200, we'll be heading to much lower levels before a potential mid term bounce.

BTC currently trading around $25,000 after a steep lower time frame drop from $26,000 which has also dragged down alts in the market. If BTC manages to hold above $25,000 on the daily, we could see another bounce and rally towards $26,000 and $27,000 in the next few days. If BTC breaks and closes below $25,000, we'd be in for a much lower retest before a bounce.

If the bulls hold on to their current short term strength and build momentum, we're heading straight for $26,800 again.

We've broken above $26,000 with determination and most higher leverage short positions are out for now.

The bulls have managed to hold decent strength above $26,000 after retesting $24,800 and bouncing on the last couple of days. If BC manages to remain above $26,000 on the daily, we could very much see a continuation towards our next mid term resistance level at $29,000 which would also take our current alts much higher.

We could very much see a higher continuation for BTC and alts if we see a solid daily break and close above $31,500, which should be confirmed in the next couple of days. A break and close below $30,000 on the other hand, would take us towards $29,000 for another mid term retest.

During the early stages of the 2020-2021 bull market, the LUNA debacle and FTX fallout led to a regime of strong accumulation and preference for self-custody. Most exchanges experienced 5k-10k Bitcoin daily net outflows.

However, on multiple occasions, Binance demonstrated the opposite behavior, where large inflow volumes accompanied market sell-off events and downtrends.

Around our daily close yesterday, we saw the bears starting to gain lower time frame strength and volume, sending BTC once again towards $30,900, where we're currently trading. If we see an increase in bearish pressure, we'll likely see BTC breaking below $30,000 in the next few days. If the bulls break and close on the daily above $31,500, we're heading straight to $33,000

PNL Report: June, 2023

Most traders in tis market become either perma-bulls or parma-bears… which is the reason most of them end up losing money. In the meantime, we’re perfectly catching all the most profitable moves, both the best long and short, before any other traders even realize, and that’s what makes us the best😉
